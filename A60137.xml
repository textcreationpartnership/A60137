            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>'TWill be generally granted that Funeral Diſcourſes are more like to affect than ordinary Sermons, becauſe of the freſh Inſtances and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, which give occaſion to 'em. If the matter be Inſtructive and Awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening, Practical, and Serious, they may be of ſingular Advantage to the Relations and Acquaintance of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed; and of ſome unto other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, becauſe the <hi>Living know that they ſhall dye.</hi> I am not without Hope that theſe may be of ſome uſe to the Friends and Relatives, at leaſt, of the
<pb facs="tcp:41795:3"/>Deceaſed Perſons. This is ſufficient to ſatisfie me, whatever Cenſures I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr, that I do well to publiſh 'em.</p>
            <p>I know this Nation abounds with good Books of practical Divinity, beyond any other in the World, and I rejoyce in it. Methinks it ought to be a real Pleaſure to a Good Man, to ſee the various Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſome plain, practical uſeful Books, becauſe we may conclude that there are many thouſands in <hi>England</hi> who reliſh and read ſuch Books, or ſo many would never ſell.</p>
            <p>It might be expected, that I ſhould have ſaid ſomewhat more particular of the Perſon, whoſe Death occaſion'd the firſt <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi> Her Acquaintance may think many things Praiſe-worthy in her Character, and Converſation, will accuſe my ſilence. But my Relation and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, according to the common Cuſtom and Uſage of the Word, made it unfit for
<pb facs="tcp:41795:3"/>me: (and my Brother <hi>Spademan</hi> by his <hi>Funeral Sermon,</hi> which is here added, hath made it now leſs needful;) thô I muſt ſay, <hi>that Cuſtom</hi> hath this Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience attending it, that the only way almoſt by which we can attain to the true Knowledge of any Perſons Character, is thereby become an Argument againſt the publiſhing it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only requeſt of him that Reads, as a Friend who deſires thy Salvation, as ever thou hopeſt for the Comforts of a Dying man, or wilt anſwer it to God and Conſcience at laſt, that thou learn by theſe Diſcourſes, to Retire now and then, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to bethink thy ſelf of <hi>thy own Death;</hi> which is as certain as the Death of any of thoſe, whoſe Funeral thou haſt attended, or whoſe Funeral Sermon thou haſt heard or read: And beg of God the Wiſdom to conſider <hi>thy Latter End,</hi> and <hi>Prepare to follow:</hi> And then be
<pb facs="tcp:41795:4"/>true to God, and thy own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, reſolvedly to Act and Live in that manner, that ſuch thoughts ſhall ſuggeſt to be wiſeſt and moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Do not refuſe or deny me this, as thou wilt anſwer it to thy Judge, who may ſummon thee before his Bar in <hi>an hour which thou thinkeſt not of.</hi> Farewell.</p>

                  <p>COnſidering what I have Formerly preach't and publiſh't for the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of other Mourners, you will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily believe, that ſince the late Providence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41795:7"/>which occaſions this Diſcourſe, that paſſage of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to <hi>Job</hi> hath often been ſuggeſted to me, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. v. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Behold thou haſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed many, and haſt ſtrengthened the weak hands. Thy words have upholden him that was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and thou haſt ſtrengthened the feeble knees: But now it is come upon thee, and thou fainteſt; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</hi> Thro' the Mercy of God, I hope, I do not murmur or <hi>faint;</hi> but ſhould it be thought ſtrange, that I am <hi>Troubled,</hi> when the Deſire of mine Eyes is removed by a ſudden ſtroke? Would it not be faulty and provoking to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe affected? to diſregard the Hand of God? deſpiſe his Chaſtening? or be unconcerned at the Voice of his Rod? How far, and how long, and to what degree to mourn, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, is a matter of ſome Difficulty; to keep within the Chriſtian limits, ſo as neither to offend God, nor lay a Stumbling-block be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the leſs judicious, or leſs candid Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers. And of like difficulty is it, rightly to underſtand and uſe the proper grounds of ſupport under ſuch an Exerciſe. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will atteſt, that divers things are wont to be offer'd for our Relief in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that will by no means adminiſter it, but are weak and ineffectual to any ſuch Purpoſe. Thô thanks be to God the Goſpel doth not leave us deſtitute of ſufficient Inſtructions, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our Mourning, to regulate our Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sorrows, and ſuſtain our Souls in an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41795:7"/>humble ſubmiſſive Adoration of the Divine Good Pleaſure. Some of theſe I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to recollect, after I have conſidered the extraordinary Inſtance of this Text; where we find the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by God to mourn for the death of his Wife; having receiv'd an expreſs order not to teſtifie his Affection by any of the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rites, and Cuſtoms of Mourning, uſed among the Jews on the like Occaſion. <hi>Alſo the Word of the Lord came unto me, ſaying, Son of Man, behold, I take away from thee the Deſire of thine Eyes with a ſtroke, yet neither ſhalt thou mourn nor weep, neither ſhall thy Tears run down:</hi>—</p>
                  <p>For the better underſtanding of this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, you muſt know, that this Prophet had for ſeveral years publiſh't the orders of God, and denounc'd Judgments in his Name unto <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but without the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fruit of his Miniſtry, without the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his important Meſſages and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The generality of the People applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Rhetorick, but continued to do after the Luſts of their Hearts, and the ſight of their Eyes; and would not hearken to his repeated Calls to Repentance; or be awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd by the moſt awfull Threatnings of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Calamity. Hereupon God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to take another Method, and try if his Sufferings would not be inſtructive unto thoſe to whom his Preaching had been little

The following part of the Chapter declares this to be the general ſcope and meaning of this Paſſage.</p>
                  <p>Wherein we may conſider, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral</hi> Sence of the words, in relation to this Prophet. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Parabolical</hi> meaning of them in relation to the People of the Jews. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Practical</hi> Improvement of this Inſtance, as to <hi>Ordinary Caſes</hi> of the Death of Relations, and Mourning for 'em. The former will tell us what theſe Expreſſions ſignifie in themſelves: the Second what they were deſigned by God to repreſent to the Jews; which will make way for what may be inſtructive from both, whenever God takes away the Deſire of our Eyes, by Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or any other ſtroke.</p>

                  <p>Under the <hi>Firſt Enquiry</hi> we may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of three things. 1. The Title here gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Prophet, <hi>Son of Man.</hi> 2. The Calamity threatned, <hi>Behold, I take away the Deſire of thine Eyes with a ſtroke.</hi> 3.

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> This Title, of <hi>Son of Man,</hi> we find given him almoſt an hundred times in this Prophecy. That it ſhould be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him as a Type of Chriſt, who is ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten called <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> I know no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reaſon to prove, for that Appellation ſeems to have reſpect to his Mediatory Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as that true Son of Man, or promiſed Seed, who was to bruiſe the Serpents head; and not only to be the Saviour of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but a light to the Gentiles, and allied unto all Mankind: <hi>

If the Spirit of God had not reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd this Inſtance to have been one of the moſt ſmarting and afflictive of all private and particular loſſes, it could not have been fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made uſe of here. If the loſs of a tender Parent, or of a beloved Child, or any other Relation, had been ſuperior or equal to this,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41795:9"/>the death of ſome or other of thoſe Relations would rather have been mention'd inſtead of this.</p>
                  <p>It may therefore be thought reaſonable, that when the Inferiour Prieſts were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under the Law to <hi>defile themſelves for the Dead,</hi> ſave only for their neareſt kindred, <hi>Levit.</hi> 21.3, 4. that the <hi>Wife</hi> muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, thò not expreſs'd.

It were needleſs to tell him, he might afflict himſelf in that caſe, when it is granted as to the leſſer, and more remote Relatives. The Margin of ſome Bibles would intimate it was forbidden unto a Prieſt, being an Husband among his People, to defile himſelf by Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Mourning for his <hi>Wife;</hi> but it may better be read, He ſhall not defile himſelf <hi>for a Chief man</hi> or Magiſtrate, <hi>among his People,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much leſs might he do ſo for any other, ſave his neareſt Kindred and Relations.

Do not Lament, and Sigh, or lift up thy Voice; but reſtrain and curb thy Sorrows, and all the ordinary Expreſſions of them. There were ſolemn mourning Lamentations among the Jews: Thus for <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 Chron. 35.24. It is threatned againſt <hi>Jehojachim,</hi> That they ſhould not <hi>lament</hi> for him, when he died, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.18. ſaying, <hi>Ah! my Brother!</hi> And the contrary promiſed as a Favour to <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> Jer. 34.5. The firſt ſolemn Lamentation, or Cry, was at the Cloſing of the Eyes, by thoſe who had aſſiſted the Deceaſed, during that laſt Sickneſs: And then by thoſe Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, unto whom the firſt News came of ſuch
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41795:12"/>a Perſon's Death. They lift up their Voice, and with Cries and Tears repeated ſeveral times the Name of the Deceaſed. Thus did <hi>David,</hi> when he received the Tydings of <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s Death: <hi>O my Son, Abſalom! my Son, my Son Abſalom! would to God I had died for thee, O Abſalom my Son, my Son!</hi> 2 Sam. 18.33. There was likewiſe a Solemn Lamentation before the Burial, in the preſence of the dead Body, or before the Effigies of it, expoſed in a publick place: Which is called, Mourning <hi>over</hi> the Dead. This the Jews ſhould not be allowed, ſaith God, concerning their own Children <hi>ſlain by the Sword,</hi> Ver. 23. of this Chapter.</p>

                  <p>Thus <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was to be a Sign unto them; for tho God removed from him one of the moſt valuable Bleſſings that could be, yet the ſtroke was not ſo ſevere and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive unto the Prophet, but the Calamity ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by it, to come upon the Jews, was much more dreadful.</p>

Tho' he had paſs'd many Difficulties before, and met with many Temptations, and been tried with many Conflicts, as leaving his Countrey, hazarding his Life, obliged to Baniſh one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son out of his Houſe, and commanded to Sacrifice another with his own Hands; yet we do not read of his <hi>mourning</hi> and <hi>weeping</hi> till the Death of his beloved <hi>Sarah,</hi> Gen. 23.1, 2. neither is he here any where condemned for dropping a Tear upon this Occaſion.</p>
                  <p>But our great concern, in ſuch Caſes, is to keep within Bounds; as upright <hi>Job,</hi> who rent his Cloaths, and ſhaved his Head, and fell upon his Face to the ground, when he heard the News of his Childrens Death; and yet even there he worſhip'd God, and had this Teſtimony, That <hi>in all this he ſinned not,</hi> or <hi>charged God fooliſhly,</hi> Job. 1.22. For Mourn we may, and Weep we may, and Lament we may, but not with an undue Violence, as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41795:21"/>
                     <hi>David</hi> for <hi>Abſalom,</hi> 2 Sam. 18.33. Nor as <hi>Rachel</hi> for her <hi>Children,</hi> who refus'd to be <hi>comforted:</hi> Or as <hi>Rizpah,</hi> who attended the Carkaſſes of her Sons, and would not be parted from them, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.10. Or as <hi>Jacob,</hi> when <hi>Joſeph</hi> was miſſing, who will go <hi>down to the Grave to his Son mourning,</hi> Gen. 37.35. Or as <hi>Jonah,</hi> when GOd <hi>ſmote his Goard,</hi> and <hi>made it wither,</hi> Jonah. 4.8. His Spirit droopt, and he reſolves to <hi>die</hi> too.</p>
                  <p>If God takes away the Joy of our Heart, and <hi>Delight of our Eyes;</hi> (ſuch Relations as he made <hi>ſo,</hi> one that <hi>from</hi> him, and <hi>by</hi> him, and in Subordination <hi>to</hi> him, was ſo;) we muſt not yet forget our Relation to God; we muſt not over-look the Deſigns of his Providence, or the Encouragements of his Word; we muſt not Mourn as Ignorant, Hopeleſs Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, that never ſaw the Bible, or heard of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore comprize what I have to ſay as to this Occaſion, under <hi>Two Generals:</hi> The one of <hi>Duty,</hi> the other of <hi>Support,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God takes away the <hi>deſire of our Eyes with a ſtroke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> We are call'd, in ſuch a Caſe, to conſider upon what Grounds, and with what Deſign, and for what Ends, it pleaſeth God thus to Afflict and make a Tryal of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. And thereby we may learn, in what manner we ought to Regard and Improve
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41795:21"/>ſuch Diſpenſations. This will concern the Duty of thoſe who are thus exerciſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to <hi>Support</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> for the Prevention of immodoerate Sorrow and Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I ſhall conſider what is proper and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bear up a Chriſtian Spirit in ſuch Caſes; and withal take notice how vain and ineffectual are all the little Conſiderations which ſome are wont to offer, and others to have recourſe to, for Encouragement under ſuch Tryals, without going into the Sanctuary, and conſulting the Holy Oracles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> When the like Caſe doth happen, as it may to the beſt of Men, we are to conſider upon what <hi>Righteous Grounds,</hi> and with what <hi>Merciful Deſigns</hi> God doth thus afflict and prove any of us; or may do ſo, if as yet he hath not. Though God had imparted his ſecret Counſels to this Prophet, and employ'd him in the moſt Honourable, Noble and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Work, though he had been true to his Commiſſion, and faithfully delivered the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages he received; pleading the Cauſe of God with undaunted Courage and Reſolution, notwithſtanding the Hatred, and Perſecution, and Hazard of his Life, whereunto his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity expos'd him; yet God thinks fit by ſuch a <hi>ſtroke</hi> as this, to Afflict and Prove him, and make him a Sign and a Warning to others.</p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:41795:22"/>
                  <p>We ſhould not therefore wonder, as if ſome ſtrange and new thing hath happened to us, when God takes from us our moſt deſirable Relations: If he remove our deareſt Comforts, and that with very little warning: If he wound and ſmite us in the Apple of our Eye; and pluck from our Embraces that which of all Earthly Bleſſings our Heart is moſt ſet upon: We ought not in ſuch Caſes to ſay, with <hi>Gideon,</hi> Judg. 6.13. <hi>If the Lord be with us,</hi> if he accerpt us, if he favours us, <hi>how is it,</hi> and <hi>why is it, that this evil hath befallen us?</hi> As if God were obliged to gratifie us in all our Wiſhes: As if he were bound to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from us that we are unwilling to part with, though it be his own, more than ours.</p>
                  <p>My Brethren, I find it to be no ſuch eaſie matter, in practical Inſtances, to reconcile the belief of God's gracious Preſence with ſmart and preſſing Afflictions. We are ready to ſay with the Siſters of <hi>Lazarus, Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my Brother had not died.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Lord were with us, it would have been otherwiſe; we are all too prone to think and ſay ſo. Such are our miſtaken Apprehenſions concerning God, under the darkneſs of our preſent ſtate: Such is our inordinate Eſteem and Affection for Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Bleſſings: So Ignorant or Inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate are we about the Deſign and End of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41795:22"/>God in Afflicting us: So little do we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, or conſider that great Revenue of Glory which God may bring to himſelf by our ſmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Tryals: So apt are we to look back on the Comforts we have loſt, and let our Thoughts looſe to aggravate our preſent Wants, by reviewing the Advantages we once enjoy'd, and are now deprived of: So par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, ſo ſlightly, ſo ſeldom do we contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the Nature and Tenure of the Covenant of Grace, which does ſuppoſe, and make al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for ſuch Viſitations, and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for our Relief under them: And ſo it comes to paſs, that we are too ready to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion his Fatherly Love, by reaſon of ſuch Rebukes: Not conſidering that <hi>whom the Lord loves, he chaſteneth,</hi> and <hi>ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth,</hi> Heb. 12.6. But the Uſefulneſs and Neceſſity of ſuch Providences, and the Wiſdom and Faithfulneſs of God therein, may be made conſpicuous to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering Mind: And it is frequently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Experience of thoſe who are exerciſed in this kind, That it is no more than is needful, that we ſhould ſometimes be in heavineſs by ſuch Diſpenſations: As will appear by conſidering a few things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Such Providences are proper to Awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Repentance,</hi> for our many Omiſſions and Failings, in the Relation we ſtood to them whom God hath taken from us. How ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41795:23"/>ſhould we reflect, Did I diſcharge the Duty of my Place to ſuch, or ſuch a deceaſed Relative? Did I value and prize ſuch a Mercy as I ought? Did I thankfully Improve ſuch a Bleſſing as I might? It is our fault and folly, as well as our unhappineſs, that we ſeldom know how to prize and uſe ſuch Mercies, till God hath depriv'd us of them. And that neglect is no way to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triev'd, but by a penitent ſenſe of our Error, in compliance with the Call of God: That Call of God, I mean, which he gives us by their Removal. And it is part of the Wiſdom of God's Government, to order our Tryals and Afflictions, for the kind, for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and for the ſeaſon of them, as may beſt ſerve to convince us of our Sin, and promote our Repentance.</p>
                  <p>For Example, <hi>Children</hi> ſhould conſider upon the Death of <hi>Holy Parents,</hi> in what Inſtances they failed of hearkning to their Counſels, and following their Inſtructions, Admonitions, and Examples; of paying that Honour, Reverence, Duty, and Obedience which God commands. They ſhould then remember, conſider, and mourn, to think how often their Miſcarriages againſt God, and them, was a Grief and Burthen to their Souls, and made them walk ſoftly: They ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call the Vanity of their Childhood, and review the Stubbornneſs, and Frowardneſs, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractableneſs of Youth; and the many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41795:23"/>provocations they were guilty of while their Parents lived; againſt their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Reproofs, againſt the cry of their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the meaning of their Tears, againſt their many Warnings, and Compaſſionate Calls to Repentance, againſt all the methods God uſed to awaken, humble, and reform them: Is not this the voice of ſuch a Rod to many Children, when their godly Parents are taken away by Death? And the like Reflections ſhould <hi>Parents</hi> make, when God removes their grown Children; whether they have anſwered their Truſt, and been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their Souls; ſolemnly dedicating them to God, endeavouring to inſtruct them in the Principles of Religion, and Educating them in the Chriſtian Faith, and ſaving them from the Temptations of the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil; endeavouring by all means to make Religion amiable, and Sin odious, and practical Godlineſs lovely, by their own Circumſpect walking, by keeping up the Authority of God, and his daily Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in their houſes, by faithful Inſtructions, and prudent ſeaſonable Reproofs, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Holy Prayer to God for them, and with them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like for other Relations, when <hi>the Deſire of our Eyes</hi> is removed, as a Dear Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or a beloved Wife. God expects we ſhould reflect, and conſider, whether we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into ſuch a Relation, as becomes CHri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41795:24"/>
                     <hi>marrying in the Lord:</hi> Whether we did walk as Heirs of the Grace of Life together: whether by tenderneſs and Affection, by Meekneſs and Wiſdom, by Watchfulneſs and Prayer, by Counſel and other Aſſiſtance, we faithfully performed the Duty of that Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We ought to reflect in ſuch caſes, How much more good we might have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and done with reference to the Deceas'd? How much more we might have contributed than we did, to the furtherance of their Grace and Holineſs, their Knowledge and Comfort, their peace of Conſcience, and meetneſs for Heaven? or what Advantage and Increaſe of <hi>our own,</hi> we might have had by their means, and did not improve. You that are now Happy in one anothers Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, remember this, before a parting time do come: for ſuch thoughts as theſe will be apt to follow us, under ſuch providences, and it is fit they ſhould.</p>
                  <p>And if we have the warning of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Change by <hi>Sickneſs;</hi> it may then be proper to reflect, how we then demean'd our ſelves? whether we were duly ſenſible of it? what was the Temper of our Spirits in prayer for them? and what our carriage and deportment toward them, and toward God, with relation to their caſe: How far we expected and prepared for a Separation by Death? what ſolemn acts of Reſignation of them, and of our ſelves, to the Will of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41795:24"/>God, our Spirits were formed to? what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions their Sick-bed Diſcourſes, their Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Speeches, Comforts, or Counſels, with their laſt Agonies, had upon us? what Duty lyes upon us at ſuch a time, in reference to theſe things, is ſufficiently obvious: But how far we then comported with it, ought ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to be inquired, when God hath remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them by Death; that wherein we have failed, we may be awaken'd to <hi>Repent,</hi> which is <hi>one Deſign</hi> of God by ſuch a ſtroke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To teſtifie his Diſpleaſure for our fond <hi>Inordinate Affections</hi> to thoſe Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives he ſnatcheth from us, and to prevent the like as to thoſe that ſurvive.</p>
                  <p>God is Jealous of his Honour, and he will not bear a Rival: and if the <hi>Deſire of our Eyes</hi> lay too near our Hearts, and rob him of our Delight, and Love, and Time, no wonder if he make a Separation. When <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s Affection to his <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> were ſo exceſſive, that his Life was bound up in theirs, <hi>he</hi> and <hi>his</hi> muſt then be parted: And the good Old Man be brought to ſay with a doleful accent, and aking Heart, <hi>Joſeph is not, and Simeon is not, and muſt Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin go too? all theſe things are againſt me.</hi> A Husband, a Wife, a Mother, a Father, a Child, a Friend which is as thy own Soul; Any of them, All of them muſt go, <hi>if we Love them too well.</hi> i. e. if we value them too
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41795:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>highly; if we delight in them exceſſively; if we rejoyce in them more than in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God; if we place the ſatisfaction of our Minds, the ſolace of our Lives, too much in their Company; if we love them not <hi>only</hi> in the Lord, or in ſubordination to him; if we reckon too much content in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance; if we are too unwilling to part with them at the Call of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This we may be ſure of, God will break that from us, from which we would not be broken, or turn it to our Croſs. And that <hi>ſtroke</hi> which makes the breach, ſhould teach us to moderate <hi>our Affections</hi> to ſurviving <hi>Friends;</hi> to Poſſeſs, Enjoy and Uſe all things and perſons in this World, <hi>as if we uſed them not, becauſe the time is ſhort, and the faſhion of the World paſſeth away,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.31. That we may be brought to ſpeak it as the inward ſence of our very Hearts: <hi>Lord,</hi> I ſee all Earthly Comforts are wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gourds, how quickly, how eaſily, how ſuddenly are they gone! O let me hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward, make thee my only Portion and Treaſure; let me ſeek thy Favour, value thy Love, prize thy preſence, in and above all things: thou art the only Fountain of <hi>Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water,</hi> all Creatures are but broken Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns, that can hold little or none; and how unexpectedly may they be dry'd up! <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> and who or what is there <hi>deſireable on Earth beſides thee?</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:41795:25"/>Happy is that Soul who Anſwers this deſign of God, and is brought to this frame by ſuch a ſtroke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God may ſometimes intend to Try our Sincerity, and Improve our Truſt in him alone. To know what is in our Hearts, <hi>i. e.</hi> To let it be known unto our ſelves and others, whether we can love him as a Father, though we feel his Rod: whether we can ſtoop to his Diſpoſing Authority, and ſubmit to his Hand, when it is moſt heavy: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in his Orders, when they are moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere. To try whether we can <hi>receive Evil from God, as well as Good:</hi> and bleſs him for Taking, as well as Giving: to try whether we can truſt him, though he ſlay us; and ſay with <hi>Hezekiah, Good is the Word of the Lord,</hi> even when he calls for the <hi>Deſire of our Eyes.</hi> To try whether we can believe his Word, truſt his Providence, and depend upon his Care, and hope for his Salvation when the Helps, and Aſiſtances, and Inſtruments of his Mercy, which we formerly had, are withdrawn. In a word, whether God <hi>alone</hi> he enough for our Souls to live upon; and be reckon'd ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for our Stay, Suport, and Strength, whatſoever Diſappointments, Loſſes, and Difficulties we meet with. Whether we will abide by our Agreement, when we firſt yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſelves to the Lord, to be abſolutely diſpos'd of, as well as rul'd by him. And
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41795:26"/>how often have we ſince renew'd that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and given up our ſelves and ours to the Lord: He will try by ſuch providences, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are ſatisfied he ſhall take us at our word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Sometimes he does it as a Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative for <hi>Patience</hi> under further Tryals, either Perſonal and particular, or publick and National. God in wiſdom inures our Spirits to a ſuffering State, and brings us off by degrees from the Love of this World. He trains us up in Self-denying-Exerciſes, that we may be the better prepared to meet him in the way of his Judgments: That by Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, we may learn to ſuffer. He takes away ſomewhat which we dearly loved, that it may be leſs difficult for us to part with the Remainder: That our proud Hearts being humbled, and our ſtubborn Wills bowed, we may be more ready to bear, and ſuffer, and loſe, as he ſhall think fit. We need be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed a good while in the School of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, perfectly to learn Patience, and Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Will of God. So difficult a Leſſon as that of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> will not be learned all at one time. <hi>One</hi> Inſtance of a calm Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Divine Will, may diſpoſe us for <hi>another</hi> that is more difficult; for if we cannot give up our <hi>Relations</hi> to the Will of God, how ſhall we be able to reſign <hi>our Selves?</hi> If the Foot-men tire us, how ſhall we contend with
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41795:26"/>Horſes? If we can't part with the Life of a <hi>Friend</hi> we love, how ſhall we ſurrender our <hi>Own,</hi> if he ſhall call us to do ſo? If we ſend up our impatient Murmurs to Heaven, when any of them die, (though it be peaceably on their Beds,) how ſhall we be able to reſiſt unto Blood? or to die at a Stake, if that ſhould ever become our Duty? If the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities common to Men be ſo heavy for our Shoulders, what ſhall we do in a Fiery Tryal? Therefore God in Wiſdom remembers our Ignorance and Frailty, and conſiders our Weakneſs, and accordingly he trains up and prepares us by degrees.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Laſt and General Reaſon of all ſuch <hi>Strokes,</hi> is to mind ſurviving Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Acquaintance, and all that hear of it, <hi>to prepare to follow.</hi> All the frequent Warnings of God, which you have lately had of this kind, ſpeak very loudly the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of our bleſſed Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.44. <hi>Be ye alſo ready.</hi> Conſider your Latter End; Number your Days; Know that you haſten to an Eternal State. Some of us eſpecially ſhould take the Warning, unto whom the Blow comes nearer home. When Death enters into the very Houſe where we ſojourn; and leſſens or diſſolves our Families; when God draws away the Veil, and expoſes the Picture of Death naked to our view, and holds it before our Eyes; he bids us, of all others,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41795:27"/>make haſte with our Work, and be ready; and not fooliſhly ſlatter our ſelves, that we have many Years to come in this World. Do we not ſee our own Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that were more likely to live than we, Month after Month, drop into the Grave? And <hi>is it not the Houſe appointed for all the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> Shall we not think our own turn is coming? May not Thine be next, or Mine next? Does not every deceaſed Friend tell us, we are living-dying Perſons, who ſhall ſhortly follow them, but they not return to us: Their Seats and Places, here and at home, ſhall hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth know them no more: And will it not e're long be as certainly true of us, of every one of us, as true as if our Breath were gone, and our Eyes cloſed, and our Teeth ſet, and our Friends had left us as if, we were laid in the Graves, and the Funeral Ceremonies were over, and our Bodies cover'd with the Bones and Earth that muſt be our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in, the houſe of Darkneſs? Oh that we were wiſe to underſtand, and believe this, and conſider our Latter End! Thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Duty of Mourners.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. For the prevention of <hi>Immoderate Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> and Irregular Mourning, which is next to be conſidered: I deſire it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that many perſons ſeek for Comfort in ſuch Caſes, where it is not to be had; and hope to encourage and ſupport themſelves from
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41795:27"/>weak, miſtaken, or deceitful Principles: we are apt to lean on ſome broken Reed, that will not ſuſtain but pierce us. Under this and the other leaf we ſeek for Conſolation, and find a Serpent lurking there; but all our turnings of devices proves but like the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Clay, which breaks and moulders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Fingers: We would fain draw the Water of Comfort out of this Brook, or the other Puddle, inſtead of going to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Well, the true and only Fountain: I mean, inſtead of conſulting the Holy Scriptures. We diſquiet our Minds in vain, ſtretch our Imaginations, and buſie our inquiring thoughts, to find out Remedies againſt the Evils we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, but till we go into the Sanctuary, we ſearch in vain.</p>
                  <p>All the Precepts and Inſtructions of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers are weak and ineffectual to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. To change the Nature of Afflictive Evils, or wholly to extirpate our own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, will be found impoſſible: Fatal Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity aſſerted by ſome, and the Doctrine of Contingency and Chance, explained by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, will not quiet or ſatisfie an Afflicted Mourner. To ſay we ſhould have conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expected this, and the like Calamity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, is in ſome ſence true; but does not that inflict as much of the Evil before, as it takes off afterward? For ſuch
<note n="*" place="bottom">Parker's <hi>Demonſt. of the Law of Nat.</hi> part 1. §. 28.</note> a fore.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41795:28"/>ſight and Expectation cannot be without An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety, and many ſad and melancholly thoughts: I mean, upon Principles meerly Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, it cannot. And therefore it is a Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table point among that fort of men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be beſt to be ſurprized by an Evil, or to pre-meditate and foreſee it's approach. Both grant we are condemned to be miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Think upon it before-hand, ſays the one ſort, that you may feel it the leſs: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think of it before, ſays the other, with equal reaſon, that you may not feel it twice.</p>
                  <p>But others more plauſibly, and with ſome Weight, will be ready to ſay, You knew a <hi>Parting Time</hi> muſt come: You knew the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial Union might eaſily, and ſuddenly, be diſſolved and broken by Death. What did you not know, that you and your Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt Die? or did you not live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with this deſign, to help and prepare one another for Death? And the Providence of God continued ſuch a ſuitable Relation to you for ſo many years: might he not have made this breach ſooner? you ought to be thankful for ſuch a bleſſing ſo long.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it may be added as to the <hi>manner</hi> of their Diſeaſe, they had what Art and Care could do to preſerve their Lives; and earneſt prayer to God was added, if it did conſiſt but with his Holy Pleaſure, that they might be longer ſpar'd. And after all, they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41795:28"/>Died quietly on their Beds, and went to the Grave in peace, and died Lamented, and the laſt Offices of Friendſhip were perform'd at their Funerals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, you know not but they <hi>are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from the evil to come;</hi> for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the beginning and progreſs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Deliverances thus far, ſome of us may live to ſee the Cup of Trembling, that our Neighbours and Brethren have drank of, come round to us, ſo that the dead may be accounted more happy than the Living: As the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.10. <hi>Weep not for the Dead, but weep for him that goes forth, and eſcapeth Death.</hi> You know not but ſuch a Calamity may befall this Land, this City, or their own Family, or Deareſt Friends, as would have made their Lives bitter, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, if they had been prolong'd.</p>
                  <p>And were nothing of all this to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, it might yet be ſaid, <hi>It is in vain to weep and mourn, you cannot call back the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of your Eyes to Life again.</hi> You only tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and hurt your ſelf, for heavineſs in the Heart of Man makes it ſtoop, it dries the bones, and deadens the Spirit, and very much unfits for the Duties and Comforts of Life. Yea, which is worſe, Immoderate ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for your departed Friends, does but prove that you love this World too well; it ſhews too plainly, that your Faith concerning the Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Future World is very weak; that you your
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41795:29"/>ſelves as yet are too unprepar'd to die; or count upon tarrying longer here, than it may be God intends you ſhall. Theſe and ſuch like conſiderations have all their influence and uſe, in their proper place, to contribute ſomewhat to our ſupport, but of themſelves are not ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>There are four things, (among others,) that a Chriſtian Mourner ought to conſider for his Relief.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whoſe Hand it is that gives the <hi>ſtroke,</hi> who it is that does it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> of God to his Covenant Promiſe, notwithſtanding any ſuch Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Gain of thoſe who Die in the Lord, by our loſs of their Company.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Our Belief and Hope of meeting them again, with all the Children of the Kingdom, and being with them for ever with the Lord in Glory. And let me add, our Expectation of <hi>knowing</hi> them there; for that to me is more than probable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> We ſhould not Grieve immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when <hi>Dear Relations</hi> are remov'd <hi>by Death,</hi> becauſe it is the <hi>Lord</hi> that doth it; he who hath a Soveraign Authority and unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Right to diſpoſe of us and them, as ſeems him good. <hi>I take away the Deſire of thine Eyes with a ſtroke;</hi> I have done it, ſaith the Lord. We miſtake our Tenure, if we
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41795:29"/>think he may not call for for his own, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he pleaſeth. The Lord <hi>gives,</hi> and the Lord <hi>takes,</hi> we muſt adore and bleſs his Holy Name in both: He is not reſponſible at our Bar, or Accountable to us, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing he does: He hath not given us an account of all his matters: He does not think fit to anſwer all our Queſtions, or ſay all he can, to vindicate the Righteouſneſs, and Wiſdom of his preſent proceedings, — <hi>therefore, why doſt thou ſtrive with him?</hi> Job 33.13. Asa <hi>Ruler,</hi> it is true he hath ſhewed us reaſon enough in the general for ſuch Providences, but as our abſolute <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Owner,</hi> he need not.</p>
                  <p>It may be we importunately prayed for their Recovery, that God would ſpare them longer: But if we did not pray with a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubmiſſion to his holy Will, our very Prayer was a Provocation, and we need to repent, and mourn for our ſelves. And do not all holy Parents, pray more earneſtly for the Salvation of their Children, and yet you know they are not all anſwer'd in kind: if they were, all the World would be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; for doubtleſs holy <hi>Noah</hi> prayed for all his Children; and they, if they were holy, would do ſo for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But do we not daily ſupplicate for the honour of Gods Government, for the Glory of his Name, the accompliſhment of his Councels, and the fulfilling of his unerring Will? and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41795:30"/>ſhall we Repine and Murmur, when our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are anſwer'd?</p>
                  <p>Conſider then, <hi>whoſe Hand it is:</hi> It is He hath taken who gave thee that, and all thy other Mercies, and prolongs innumerable ones, which thou haſt forfeited: And <hi>ſhall we not receive evil at the hand of God, as well as good?</hi> Job 2.10. Eſpecially ſince he may have the ſame kind, and merciful deſign in <hi>taking</hi> as he had in <hi>giving,</hi> and hath promiſed that <hi>all things</hi> (this not excepted) <hi>ſhall work for good:</hi> It is <hi>He</hi> hath done it, who is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Wiſe and Gracious, who loves, and pities, and ſpares us as a Father does a Child. And ſhall we not drink of that Cup which our Heavenly Father hath put into our hands? His Soveraignty might juſtly ſilence us, but his Goodneſs, Righteouſneſs, and Wiſdom, ſhould calm and ſettle our Hearts, and make us reſign our Will to his. It is <hi>He</hi> hath done it, who hath purchaſed a people out of the World, and is collecting them one after another, ſo ſoon as they are ready, and have ſerved the ends of his Glory up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth: And how ſhall the many Sons and Daughters be brought to Heaven, (for which end the Son of God was incarnate and dyed) if we and others ſhould have our wiſh, that God ſhould take whom he would, and when he pleaſed, but <hi>our Relations</hi> ſhould be excepted? It is <hi>He</hi> hath done it, who told us, <hi>that whoſoever loves Father, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41795:30"/>Wife, or Child, more than Chriſt, cannot be his Diſciple,</hi> Luke 14.26. It is <hi>He,</hi> unto whom our Relation is nearer, ſweeter, and more indiſſoluble, than <hi>that</hi> unto any of our Friends on Earth can be. It is <hi>He</hi> hath done it, who ſaid, <hi>Father, I will, that thoſe whom thou haſt given me ſhall be where I am, to behold my Glory,</hi> John 17.14. And when he would remove any of ſuch a Character, how dear ſoever unto us, ſhall our Reluctant will oppoſe and gainſay his Wife and Juſt, and Holy Pleaſure? Shall any of us dare ſay in ſuch a caſe, that <hi>he is mine,</hi> or <hi>ſhe is mine,</hi> I cannot yield to let them go? would we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate that they are more <hi>ours,</hi> than <hi>his?</hi> did he not make them? did he not renew them? and make them meet for Heaven? and ought he not rather to diſpoſe of them according to <hi>His Will,</hi> than ours? ought not ours to ſubſcribe to his?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider the <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> of God to his Covenant promiſes, notwithſtanding ſuch Providential Tryals. Whatſoever change He makes in our Families, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Bleſſed God is ſtill the ſame, what, and where he was, tho our Relations and Friends are not what they were, or where they were. Thô a Houſe be broken up, and a Family diſſolv'd, tho one or more of the principal Members of it be ſnatch'd away, we who are left, may yet with <hi>David encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41795:31"/>our ſelves in the Lord our God,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.5. ſaying, <hi>Tho' my houſe be not ſo with God, yet hath he made with me an Everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure, and this is all my Salvation, and all my Deſire:</hi> And is not this <hi>All</hi> enough? Ought we not ſo to reckon it? that tho' we ſhould be forſaken of all Creatures, God will never leave us, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake us; that we ſhall not be <hi>left alone,</hi> he will ſtill be with us; the Husband of the Widow, and the Father of the Fatherleſs; ſhewing Mercy to them that ſear him, and to their Seed after them, <hi>and his Righteouſneſs</hi> (or promiſed Mercy) <hi>to their Childrens Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> Pſal. 103.7.</p>
                  <p>Can he not be better than all Relations? could any one of them be a Bleſſing or a Comfort to us without him? Was it not from God, if any of them were ſo? how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily might he have imbitter'd their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who were the Delight of our Eyes? And can he not ſupply that Loſs out of his own fulneſs? Was he the Author of all the Comfort we enjoyed in, and by them, and cannot he make amends for their Abſence? Is not the Preſence of the God of all Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, equivalent to theirs? May he not make us Gainers? and oblige us to own by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Experience, that in very faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he hath thus afflicted? Did we better clear up our Covenant-Intereſt in the <hi>Alſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency</hi> of God, it would be a ſpecial Means of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41795:31"/>our Support, in this, and all other afflicting Caſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let us look from our ſelves to <hi>Them,</hi> whom God hath taken from us, and compare their <hi>Gain</hi> with our <hi>Loſs;</hi> and that will infer a Defect, either in our Faith, or in our Friendſhip, if we Mourn immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately for thoſe who Dye in the Lord, and ſleep in Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>I Confeſs the Death of <hi>Wicked Relations</hi> is a very perplexing, and humbling Caſe. But yet we muſt remember, God is Wiſer and more Merciful than we, and doth all things for his own Glory: And we cannot doubt, but when we come to Heaven, our Minds and Wills ſhall be entirely Conform'd to his. And for the preſent it cannot well be Anſwer'd, Why one or two of our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Kindred, that Dyed in Sin, ſhou'd be ſo much more lamented, than the many Hundreds and Thouſands, that every Week or Month are cut off under Damning Guilt. Let us thank God for his diſtinguiſhing Grace, if He have brought <hi>us</hi> to Repent, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and Obey the Goſpel; and do what we can that others alſo may, eſpecially thoſe of our Kindred and Acquaintance: with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Sorrow that we have done no more to further their Converſion and Salvation; and then we may rejoyce in the Glory of God, and our Bleſſed Redeemer, by the Faith
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41795:32"/>and Holineſs of thoſe that are or ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Were this our Temper, as it ought to be, we ſhould not be apt to grieve exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Death of our Holy Friends: For they are delivered from the Guilt and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Sin, and have received the End of their Faith, and Patience, and Hope: They have overcome the difficulties that we muſt longer Conflict with, and have ſafely paſs'd thoſe Changes we muſt yet be proved by. We have many Dangers yet to eſcape, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hazardous Temptations yet to reſiſt; a difficult Warfare yet to manage, againſt the Enemy of our Souls; many weary Dayes and Hours to paſs, under the troubleſome Effects of Sin, and the Aſſaults of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: We muſt yet tarry in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and know the Tryals of a ſojourning State, while they are got ſafe to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Reſt: We muſt yet toil, and labour, and ſtrive under the Cares, and Fears, and Wants, and Difficulties of many kinds, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward, Perſonal and Relative, publick and private, but they are beyond the reach of either; they ſhall be allur'd, or diſquieted, by the ſuggeſtions of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil no more; they ſhall be in fear of Hell, and under Apprehenſions of Gods Diſpleaſure no more; they ſhall be in hazard of infection by bad Company, or grieved by the ſcandals and ill Examples of the Ungodly no more, for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41795:32"/>they are joyned to the Holy Society above, in the bleſſed Viſions, Services, and Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings of that better World.</p>
                  <p>Not only are they deliver'd from what is now afflictive to us, but bountifully reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Happy in the Knowledge, and Love of God. Not only have they their iron Fetters knock'd off from their feet, but a Crown of Grory put upon their Heads: Not only ſtript of their filthy Garments, but cloathed with the pure and immortal Light: Not only all their Sorrows vaniſht, but their Souls filled with unutterable Joy, waiting for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of it, at the Reſurrection of the Dead.</p>
                  <p>We think, it may be, we ſtand in need of <hi>their</hi> Company; we are certain they need not <hi>ours,</hi> having left an Imperfect, Dark, Deſiling, Tempting, Troubleſome, Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble World, and are gone to a Bleſſed Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and State of Holineſs and Peace; from Doubts, and Darkneſs, and Complaints, to the Boſom of Inſinite Love, where they ſhall Complain and Weep no more for ever. And therefore tho our Saviour <hi>Wept</hi> when <hi>Lazarus</hi> dyed, becauſe it is ſaid <hi>he loved him,</hi> the reaſon ſeems to be, becauſe our Lord knew that
<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Iſid. Pelus.</hi> L. 2. Epiſt. 173.</note> 
                     <hi>Lazarus</hi> was to return to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth again; he knew that it was
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41795:33"/>for the Glory of God, that he ſhould be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the Dead, and return to be Tryed, and Tempted, and Troubled again. But it is not ſo with our departed Friends: Oh let us believingly look upward, where they are, and think what they are doing, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how much otherwiſe it was with them not long ago: And can we wiſh them back again? while we ſigh, and weep, and mourn, we know all Tears are wiped away from their Eyes, and they are ſinging the Song of the Lamb. They are now ſeeding on the pleaſant Fruits of Paradiſe, and would we have them back again to eat the Bread of Affliction, and drink the Waters of Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Would we, they ſhould return from the ſtate of Triumph, after Victory, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage again in new Combats? From the Port and Haven of Eternal Reſt, to be toſt again upon a Tempeltuous Sea? And this, becauſe they were <hi>

But how dear ſoever they were to us, <hi>we ſhall go to them, they ſhall not come to us:</hi> We are very unkind if we deſire they ſhould have Tarryed longer, when God hath made them ready; they are gone to better Friends than thoſe they have

                  </p>
                  <p>The Friends they have left are imperfect, Sinning, Sorrowing, troubleſome and unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, compared with thoſe they meet <hi>above.</hi> And <hi>there</hi> only our Friendſhip, and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to one another, will be without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Grief, or Sin, without any Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Suſpicion, Diſcontent, or other allay, by their Weakneſſes, Sins, or Sufferings: <hi>There</hi> ſhall we have all our Wiſhes, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, for our Friends, as well as for our Selves; and converſe continually together, without being weary of one anothers Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: they had once ſuch a vile Body as we have, and ſuch diſorderly Paſſions, ſuch Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and Miſtakes, and Actual Sins as we are guilty of; they were troubled with ſuch Temptations, Doubts, and Deſcrtions, as we complain of: but their probationarry State is now over, their Warfare is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd, their Work done, their Race ended, their Courſe finiſh'd, and <hi>they are enter'd into the Joy of the Lord:</hi> Oh let us remember that they are ſo, while we Weep and Mourn, partly for their Departure, and more (it ſhould be) for our unfitneſs as yet to be with them But we have the ſame God and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the ſame Way and Rule, the ſame bleſſed Recompence of Reward, propos'd and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41795:34"/>promis'd, and prepar'd; the ſame Grace and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, offered to enable us to Perſevere and Overcome. It is but a little while, ſince they had as malicious Enemies to oppoſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, and as difficult a work to mind as we, and were as unlikely to hold out, as ſome of us; their inward and outward Troubles were like to ours; their bodily Weakneſſes, and Spiritual Diſtreſſes like to ours, but they have overcome them; yet a little while, and we hope we may do ſo too. And it is <hi>but a little while;</hi> let us not then <hi>grieve immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately,</hi> being our ſelves to follow ſo ſoon after, to partake (we hope) in that Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with them for ever, which we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten joyned together in Prayer, to ask of God for them, and for our ſelves. And this we need not queſtion, if we chooſe the ſame Felicity
<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Life of Faith, ch. 26.</note> as our End, and Chriſt as the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Salvation, to direct and lead us in the way thither; if we build on the ſame Word of Promiſe, and follow the Conduct of the ſame Spirit of Holineſs; if we live in the exerciſe of the like Grace, and are conform'd to Chriſt our Head in Spirit, Purpoſe, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and hold on in doing and ſuffering his Will, with conſtancy to the Death. If we do thus, we ſhall ſhortly be with them; and becauſe we were wont to mourn with
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41795:34"/>them, when they mourned, and to take part in their Afflictions, let us do ſo in their Joys alſo; Thanking God for their Deliverance, and Rejoycing in their Felicity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The laſt Argument for our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, is <hi>the Belief and Hope of the Reſurrection of the Dead,</hi> when we ſhall meet them, and all the Children of the Kingdom, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord. We know that <hi>thoſe who ſleep in Jeſus; he will bring with him,</hi> and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſolve, and own them before all the World, and give them the full poſſeſſion of the <hi>promiſed Inheritance.</hi> We are bid to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> our ſelves, and one another, with ſuch joyful words. 'Tis <hi>Comfort</hi> that there is a Redeemer, and that he is their Redeemer, as well as ours; that he Lives, and will come again; and that we <hi>know this,</hi> on certain and infallible grounds; and <hi>that when he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, we ſhall be like him,</hi> by <hi>ſeeing him as he is.</hi> It is <hi>Comfort,</hi> that even theſe Bodies that muſt be buried out of ſight, and putrifie in a ſilent Grave, ſhall be raiſed, and enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made like the glorious Body of our Redeemer. Thô Death devour their Beauty, and the Grave hold them Priſoners for ſome thouſands of years; tho they ſhould be burnt to Aſhes, or devour'd by Worms, Beaſts, or Fiſhes, however crumbled and divided into little parts, and theſe ſcatter'd and diſpers'd into a thouſand diſtant places; yet he will
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41795:35"/>raiſe, and re-unite, and reſtore them, freſh and ſpritely, beautiful and glorious. That Power which at firſt did form, and faſhion them in the Womb, hath engaged to do it. <hi>This Corruptible ſhall put on Incorruption; and this Mortal put on Immortality; and Death be ſwallowed up in Victory.</hi> What was <hi>ſown in Weakneſs</hi> ſhall then be <hi>raiſed in Power:</hi> our Bodies ſhall then be Active and Nimble, quick and free, eaſily paſſing in a little ſpace to a great diſtance, and readily obeying the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Glorified Spirits. What was ſown <hi>a Natural, Earthly Body,</hi> ſhall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Spiritual;</hi> ſuited to the ſpiritual State, and Life, and work of Heaven; not needing the ſupplies of Food or Phyſick, or any of thoſe things which now employ ſo much of our Time and Care, in reference to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. In a word, they ſhall be <hi>raiſed in Glory,</hi> however <hi>vile</hi> they now are, as the Bodies of our <hi>Humiliation:</hi> And ſhall ſhine brighter than the Sun in it's Meridian Splendor, with a <hi>Glory</hi> ſuitable to the Excellency of that Power exerted in their Reſurrection, ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Dignity of our Glorified Souls, ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Glory of that Place, where they are to inhabit; and of the Noble Services, wherein they are to be employed; and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſuitable to their Excellent <hi>Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar,</hi> the Glorious Body of Chriſt, whoſe Reſurrection and Exaltation is the Cauſe, Pattern, and Pledge of ours.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:41795:35"/>
                  <p>And this we may depend upon, for our Lord hath not only left us <hi>the Earneſt of his Spirit,</hi> to aſſure us of the Reſurrection, that our Mortal Bodies ſhall be quicken'd by the ſame Spirit, that raiſed him from the <hi>Dead;</hi> but he hath carried <hi>the Earneſt of our Fleſh</hi> into Heaven with him, to aſſure us, that all his Friends, Favourites, and Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſhall one day be with him, to <hi>behold his Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let this then be remembred as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Chriſtian Hope, that we may not mourn,

                  <p>When God reſtored to <hi>Job,</hi> after his long Tryals, <hi>double</hi> for all his Cattel and Goods which he had loſt, as Fourteen thouſand Sheep for Seven thouſand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he gave him but the ſame number of Children again: for they were not really <hi>loſt,</hi> though Death remov'd 'em; they were <hi>Alive</hi> in another State: And if they were Holy Perſons, he had the like number in Heaven, as God gave him on Earth. It's a great Relief to a Chriſtian Mourner to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that his Deceaſed Friends are not <hi>Loſt,</hi> but <hi>Live.</hi> I know very well that the Holy Will of God muſt take place of mine: I know that I ought to love God and Chriſt above all, and abſolutely reſign my ſelf, and All that's mine, or cannot hope to ſee his Face: I know that I ſhall ſhortly follow the <hi>Deſire of mine Eyes:</hi> I hope I ſhall be ſilent, and adore, and not <hi>charge God fooliſhly.</hi> But methinks I know (with ſenſible ſupporting Inſluence from ſuch a Thought) that <hi>She is not Dead, but Sleepeth; She is not Loſt, but Lives:</hi> And if I get to Heaven, ſhall meet her there, in the preſence of the Lord our Redeemer. And then the <hi>Company</hi> of our Holy <hi>Relatives</hi> will be more <hi>Sweet</hi> than ever it was on Earth.</p>
                  <p>For though the Bleſſed Viſion of God be our <hi>Chiefeſt</hi> Hope and Joy, yet the Preſence of all the Bleſſed Spirits will make a <hi>Real,</hi> though Subordinate, part of our Happineſs,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41795:36"/>and Delight. <q>I am ſo far from doubting whether we ſhall <hi>Know</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> one another in the Heavenly State, that the Belief and Expectation of it, is, or ſhould be, one great Motive why we love 'em ſo well now.</q> If we thought we ſhould not Know and Love them after Death, we ought to Love 'em but as Earthly, Tranſitory things, and not as <hi>Heirs of Heaven,</hi> with ſuch a Love as ſhall be perfected, and laſt for ever.</p>
                  <p>Neither can it well be imagin'd how the Proceſs and Proceedings of the Judgment-Day, according to the Scripture Account of it, can be manag'd by <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> (or the Lord Redeemer cloath'd with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature,) without our Knowledge of One Another in the <hi>other</hi> World, who were acquainted, and convers'd together in <hi>this.</hi> 'Tis true, the preſent Relations by Marriages and Blood will then ceaſe; but there is no reaſon to think, that the Remembrance of thoſe Relations muſt alſo ceaſe: Yea, their Knowledge and Remembrance of us, and their Affection to us, whom we knew, and lov'd in the Lord, is not like to be <hi>aboliſh'd,</hi> but <hi>perfected by Dying.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But as to our Mutual Knowledge in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſtate: Shall thoſe whom we Reliev'd on Earth, Welcome us to Heaven? And are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid to <hi>receive us into Everlaſting Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> Luk. 16. And ſhall not the departed Saints know one another in Glory? Shall we then know, <hi>as we are known?</hi> And ſhall the <hi>Theſſalontans</hi> be the Joy, and Crown, and Glory, and Rejoycing of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Day of Chriſt? And ſhall he not know them, or they him, who proſited by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry? Did the Rich Man in Hell know <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> afar off in Heaven, and can we think a bleſſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhall not? For though that be a Parable, there is ſome Truth as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it. Shall it aggravate the Miſery of loſt Souls, to meet their wicked Companions in the place of Torment? as few deny, or doubt: And ſhall it not Rejoyce the Bleſſed, to meet their Holy Friends whom they knew in this World? Did <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> know <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> in the Transſignration, whom they never ſaw before? (and we read not that Chriſt told em 'who they were:) And ſhall thoſe who were acquainted upon
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41795:37"/>Earth, and helpt one another to Heaven; utterly forget, and loſe the remembrance of any ſuch thing?</p>
                  <p>It is a pleaſant Thought, (and proper to ſupport under the Death of thoſe we have honoured, and loved, and profited by, on Earth,) to think that hereafter we ſhall meet, and know, ſeveral Miniſters of Chriſt, whoſe Preaching, and Converſe, and Writings, have been uſeful to us: That we ſhall then meet, and know, ſeveral of our Holy <hi>Relations</hi> and Acquaintance, with whom we were wont to walk together to the Houſe of God, and meet often at the Table of the Lord; with whom we conferr'd about the Miſteries and and Promiſes of the Goſpel, and many a time diſcours'd together of the Heavenly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; believingly to foreſee, and conſider, that though they are gone before, we ſhall meet 'em again, at the laſt great Supper of the Lamb, in the Celeſtial Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>And why may not I ſuppoſe ſuch a diſtinct and perſonal Knowledge, and Remembrance of one another, as to be able to ſay, <hi>This was the Perſon,</hi> whom God employed to bring me into the World, and educate me in his Fear; who inſtructed my tender Years, and taught me early to Know the Lord. Or, <hi>This was the Perſon,</hi> who was at ſo much pains to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me of my Sin, and reclaim me from the Errour of my Ways: <hi>This was He,</hi> or <hi>She,</hi> who tendred my Salvation as their own; who
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41795:38"/>watch'd over me, and pray'd for me, and with me; and often told me of the Evil of Sin, of the Excellency and Pleaſantneſs of Wiſdom's Ways, of the Freeneſs of the Love and Grace of Chriſt, and his Willingneſs to receive Returning Penitents at firſt, and even Backſliders afterwards. <hi>This was the Perſon,</hi> who was aſſiſted by God to encourage, ſtrengthen, revive, and comfort my deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my doubting, my unbelieving Heart; and eſtabliſh me in the way of Truth: Yea, to be able to ſay, <hi>This was the Perſon,</hi> with whom I lived, and ſo journed in yonder World; whoſe ſincere Affection I ſo much valued; whoſe delightful, uſeful Company, I ſo much prized, whoſe Sickneſs and Removal I ſo much lamented, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>— But leſt I run too far, let me draw to a Cloſe.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore, after what hath been ſaid, reſolve to have <hi>Communion</hi> with them, though they are Departed; by Contemplating <hi>what</hi> they are, and <hi>where</hi> they are, and what they <hi>do,</hi> and what they <hi>poſſeſs;</hi> and by Rejoycing in their Bleſſedneſs, more than we would have done for their Temporal Advancement in any kind on Earth. Let us deſire and endeavour to be <hi>as like</hi> 'em as we can, by imitating their Temper and Work above, in the Love of God, and the delighful thankful Praiſes of the Redeemer. When we look up to <hi>Heaven,</hi> let us think <hi>they</hi> are <hi>there.</hi> When we think
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41795:38"/>of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> let us remember <hi>they</hi> are part of <hi>his Family</hi> above. When we think with hope of entring into <hi>Heaven our Selves,</hi> let us think with Joy of meeting <hi>them</hi> there. <q>Oh welcome, welcome, happy meeting with Chriſt, and them; Never more to Part, never more to Mourn, never more to Sin. <hi>O Happy Change! O Bleſſed Society!</hi> (ſhall we then cry out,) with whom we ſhall live for ever, to Know, and Love, Admire, and Praiſe, and Serve our Common Lord! We formerly Sinn'd together, and Suffer'd together. But this is not like our old Work or State: Our former Darkneſs, Complaints, and Sorrows are now vaniſht. This Body, this Soul, this Life, this Place, this Company, theſe Viſions, theſe Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, theſe Services and Employments, are not like what we had in the former World. And yet, which is the Quinteſſence and Spirit of all, this Happineſs ſhall laſt to all Eternity, and after Millions of Ages be as far from ending, as when at firſt began.</q> 
                     <hi>Fit us, Lord! for ſuch a Day, and Come, Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus! Come quickly.</hi> Amen.</p>

                  <p>UPON a like Exhortation of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord to Watchfulneſs, and Prayer, to Faithfulneſs, and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, in Expectation of his Coming, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> makes bold to ask the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> whether it concern'd only the Apoſtles, or was ſpoken to all, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.41. The anſwer whereto doth ſufficiently expreſs the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Obligation of ſuch a Duty. For our Lord replies, <hi>Bleſſed is that wiſe and faithful Servant, who when his Lord comes ſhall be found doing his Maſters Work.</hi> And yet more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly by another Evangeliſt, where the like Parable is apply'd with this addition, <hi>What
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41795:42"/>I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all, Watch;</hi> Mark 13. laſt. which <hi>Watching</hi> is the general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive word for being <hi>Ready.</hi> This is the repeated Voice of Chriſt in his Word, where-ever he ſpeaks of his Second Coming: This is the diſtinct and loud call of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence unto this Congregation by the Death and Funerals of one of our number; you know, I mean our Friend Mrs. <hi>Gearing,</hi> which ſpeaks the ſame language to all of us, <hi>Be ye alſo ready.</hi> And being deſired on this Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to preach from theſe words; I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the mention of ſome things, that were Inſtructive and exemplary in the <hi>Deceaſed,</hi> for the cloſe of my Diſcourſe, and in the mean time conſider this ſeaſonable Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Bleſſed Lord, <hi>Therefore be ye alſo Ready; for the Son of Man cometh in ſuch an hour, as ye think not of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This and the foregoing Verſes are part of the Anſwer, which our Saviour made to the Diſciples queſtion, in the beginning of the Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Tell us, when ſhall theſe things be,</hi> and <hi>what ſhall be the ſign of thy coming,</hi> and <hi>of the end of the World?</hi> According to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Apprehenſions which the Jews had of the alteration of the preſent ſtate of things among them, by the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and that general deſtruction of the World, and the State of Eternity which would thereupon follow, they enquire of both to gether: as reckoning his Coming and the End
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41795:42"/>of the World, would be at once. And throughout this Chapter, we find our Lord's Anſwer to both Queſtions are intermixed; ſome whereof referr to the deſtruction of the Jewiſh State, and his coming to execute judgment upon that Nation: and others, to the end of the World, whereof the former was but a figure.</p>
                  <p>It is plain that ſome paſſages referr to the Jewiſh State, ſeveral of the ſigns of his coming were literally fulfilled, a little before their deſtruction by the <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and others mention; particularly the 15. and 16. <hi>verſes: When ye therefore ſhall ſee the Abomination of Deſolation, ſpoken of by Daniel the Prophet, ſtand in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place, (whoſo readeth let him underſtand) then let them which be in Judea, flee into the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again 34. <hi>v.</hi> he ſays: <hi>This Generation ſhall not paſs away, till all theſe things be fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> There is yet no reaſon to confine the whole of this Chapter, to the Calamities which befell the Jewiſh Nation, which was but as a Type and Repreſentation of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Judgment, preceding the final Doom of the World; for ſome paſſages do as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly referr to the end of the World. As when he ſpeaks, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s coming <hi>in the Clouds with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and great glory,</hi> and <hi>of the Angels ſounding the Trumpet,</hi> and <hi>of two men in the Field,</hi> and <hi>of two Women grinding at the Mill, one taken, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41795:43"/>the other left;</hi> referring to the great Diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of perſons, that ſhall be made at the end of the World, as when it is ſaid in the 36. <hi>verſe, Of that day and hour no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, no not the Angels of Heaven, but my Father only.</hi> And by another Evangeliſt, the Son himſelf is excluded from knowing that hour, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.33. But did not Chriſt know the time of the deſtruction of the Jews, their Temple, City, and Nation? when he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf foretells the time, when it ſhould be? And therefore thoſe words in the 35. <hi>v. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but my words ſhall not paſs away,</hi> ſeem to be a tranſition from anſwering the firſt Queſtion, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Deſtruction of the Jews, to anſwer the other queſtion, about the End of the World: whereupon follows the Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the 42. <hi>v. Watch, for you know not what hour your Lord will come. But know this,</hi> (or <hi>you do know this,</hi> as the Original word will bear, and may better be rendred;) You do know this, <hi>That if the good man of the houſe had known, in what Watch of the night the Thief world come, he would have watched, and not ſuffered his houſe to be broken up: Therefore be ye alſo Ready, for the Son of Man cometh in an hour that you think not of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I hope none will be ſo weak, as to be ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the Compariſon in this paſſage of the coming of Chriſt unto that of a <hi>Thief,</hi> becauſe the all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> is only as to the <hi>unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedneſs</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:41795:43"/>of the time, and ſeaſon of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is a compariſon, or alluſion, as one ſays, <hi>Non perſonae ad perſonam, non negotii ad negotium, ſed temporis ad tempus.</hi> q. d. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel does not hold between Perſon and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, between Buſineſs and Buſineſs, but only between the Time of the ones coming, and that of the other, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Suddenneſs and Unexpectedneſs of it. In which ſence the Apoſtle mentions the coming of Chriſt as of a <hi>Thief in the Night,</hi> at a time when he is not expected, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.2. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Therefore be ye alſo ready,</hi> for He comes in a time when you think not of it. His laſt Coming, at the end of the World will be ſurprizing; and ſo is his other Coming to ſummon us out of the World by <hi>Death,</hi> which will tranſmit us over to his ſinal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For nothing can be done to make us Ready, and prepared to meet him as our Judge, but on this ſide the Grave. Our readineſs therefore for Death, and for the Coming of our Lord to Judgment, is all one.</p>
                  <p>In the words we have three parts. 1. The Certainty of Chriſts Coming again ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. 2. The Suddenneſs and Unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it aſſerted, it will be in an <hi>Hour that you think not of.</hi> 3. The Neceſſity and Obligation that reſults from thence, of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to be Ready. Accordingly I ſhall, I. Explain the Nature of this <hi>Readineſs,</hi> for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41795:44"/>the Coming of Chriſt. II. Show the force of the <hi>Argument,</hi> in ſeveral Conſiderations, from the ſuddenneſs and unexpectedneſs of his Coming, and our uncertainty of the time thereof, therefore to be <hi>Ready.</hi> III. Shall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt you to make the <hi>Application.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Certainty of his ſecond Coming is ſuppoſed: <hi>The Son of man cometh in an hour you think not of.</hi> It ſuppoſeth then that he will come again. <hi>The Son of man</hi> is a title ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often given to Chriſt, and aſſumed by himſelf, particularly with relation to the Final Judgment; for we read, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>hath committed all Judgment to the Son, and given him Authority to execute Judgment, as the Son of man,</hi> (or <hi>becauſe he is the Son of man</hi>) and it follows, <hi>For the hour ſhall come, that all they who are in their Graves ſhall hear his Voice, and ſhall come out of their Graves, they that have done good to the Refurrection of Life, and they that have done evil to the Reſurrection of Damnation,</hi> John 5.27, 28. And with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular relation to this, he himſelf ſpeaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.31. <hi>When the</hi> Son of man <hi>ſhall come in his glory, and all the Holy Angels with him, then ſhall he ſit upon the Throne of his glory.</hi> And when the High Prieſt adjured him, to tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were <hi>indeed the Chriſt, the Son of God,</hi> Mat. 26.63, 64. obſerve what he anſwer'd, <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall you ſee</hi> the Son of Man, <hi>ſitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the Clouds of Heaven.</hi> Some would have it an inſtance
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41795:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>of his Humility to aſſume this Title, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerring to the meaneſs of his preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World; but that does not ſeem to reach the ſence of the Expreſſion, <hi>For all Judgment is committed to him, becauſe he is the Son of Man,</hi> or becauſe He is <hi>Mediator;</hi> becauſe He is the true <hi>Seed of the Woman,</hi> promiſed <hi>to bruiſe the Serpents head;</hi> The true Son of Man, to whom <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> and a <hi>Kingdom</hi> was given by the <hi>Ancient of days,</hi> Dan. 7.13, 14. So that this Title is a Name of Office. All Supremacy, Authority and Power that belongs to the Office of <hi>Mediator,</hi> is given to him: And the Gentiles, as well as the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> may by him be juſtified, and obtain everlaſting Life. The Jews would appropriate the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as <hi>the Son of David,</hi> and the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> forgetting that he is <hi>the Son of man,</hi> promis'd from the beginning to be <hi>the Deſire of all Nations,</hi> and the Hope of all the Ends of the Earth; to redeem us unto God, out of all Nations, Tongues, Kindreds, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>The coming again of this <hi>Son of Man</hi> is here ſuppoſed. He came once as the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Redeemer, to be incarnate in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to offer himſelf a willing Sacrifice for the expiation of Sin: But he is to come again as the Judge of Quick and Dead; even this ſame Jeſus who after his Reſurrection converſed forty days upon Earth, and then
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41795:45"/>aſcended in Triumph and Glory to Heaven; <hi>This ſame Jeſus,</hi> ſaid the Angels to the two Witneſſes of his Aſcenſion, <hi>who is taken up into heaven, ſhall ſo come again as you have ſeen him go into it,</hi> Acts 1.11. This was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied by <hi>Enoch</hi> the ſeventh from <hi>Adam, Jude</hi> 14. This was foretold, and prefigur'd vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in the Old Teſtament; this was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly promiſed by our Lord, in the days of his Fleſh; eſpecially for the encouragement of his Diſciples, when he was about to leave them, and ſpeaks of his departure. This is inſiſted upon by the Apoſtles, in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Epiſtles, as a Motive to Humility, to Patience, to Perſeverance, notwithſtanding the many difficulties, and diſcouragements, which they met with for their Fidelity to Chriſt, and the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>But I need not inſiſt on the proof of this, among thoſe who own it as a fundamental Article of their Creed; That He who dyed on the Croſs, and roſe again, tho' he now ſits at the right Hand of God, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhall contain him 'till the Reſtitution of all things, yet <hi>He ſhall come again to judge the World,</hi> and determine the ſinal Everlaſting State of all Mankind. But becauſe he is not yet come, men are ready to conclude he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will; becauſe things continue as they were, one Generation paſſing, and another coming; men that walk after their own Luſts, (whoſe intereſt it is to have it true, that he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41795:45"/>ſhall not come, are ready to cry out in ſcorn, <hi>Where is the Promiſe of his Coming?</hi> 2 Pet. 3.3, 4. But for us to be ignorant that he will come again, muſt be a wilful, willing, choſen Ignorance: Becauſe the <hi>Lord is not ſlack,</hi> as Men count <hi>ſlackneſs;</hi> but <hi>a thouſand years are to him as one day:</hi> It is not Slackneſs, but Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, which ſhould lead Men to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to Prepare for his Coming: And ſo would be <hi>Salvation.</hi> For ſo it is called, from the tendency of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. And if it be not ſo to us, it is our own fault.</p>
                  <p>So unqueſtionably <hi>Certain</hi> is this Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and Second Coming of Chriſt, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> adjures <hi>Timothy,</hi> in the moſt ſolemn and affecting manner, to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſcharge of his Duty, by that Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>I charge thee before God, and before the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the quick and dead at his Appearance, and his Kingdom:</hi> or when he ſhall appear in his Kingdom, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> knew and granted, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to come as a Judge, by the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Prophecy of <hi>Enoch,</hi> which began with thoſe words, <hi>The Lord ſhall come.</hi> This they underſtood long before the Incarnation of our Saviour: So that they were wont to begin their Writs, or Inſtruments of the <hi>Greateſt Excommunication,</hi> with thoſe words of the Prophecy of <hi>Enoch, The Lord ſhall come.</hi> As if, beſides all other Puniſhments,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41795:46"/>they Bound over the Excommunicated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the laſt great Aſſize, to be Judged by the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſeems to allude to this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be Anathema Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranatha: i.e.</hi> Accurſed with that great and terrible Excommunication, <hi>The Lord ſhall come.</hi> For ſo they call it from the firſt words, as we often give Names to <hi>Writs,</hi> and other Inſtruments, by reciting the firſt words of them: <hi>He ſhall come again: he ſhall be revealed from Heaven, in ſlaming ſire, with his mighty Angels, to render vengeance to them which know not God, and obey not the Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Theſ. 1.7, 9. <hi>We ſhall all be made to ſtand before his Judgment-Seat,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.10, 14. Rom. 14.10. <hi>And every one ſhall then give an account of himſelf to God, and receive accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what he hath done in the body, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi> He is dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and appointed by God for this Work, and every way fitted and qualified to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The <hi>Suddenneſs</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nexpectedneſs</hi> of his Coming again: <hi>The hour of it no man knows, no, not the Angels of God in Heaven.</hi> It will ſurprize Mankind, as the Deluge did the Old World in the days of <hi>Noah.</hi> The <hi>time</hi> of it is lock'd up in the Treaſuries of Heaven, and we have no Key that will open it. Neither the time of Chriſt's coming to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41795:46"/>Judge the World, or the time of his calling us by Death to come to him, is certainly known. <hi>Behold! I know not the day of my death,</hi> we may every one ſay with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 27.2. The Knowledge of this time and Seaſon he hath reſerved in his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; it belongs not to us, it is no part of our Priviledge to know it, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.7.</p>
                  <p>If it had been fit and becoming, adviſeable and expedient for us to underſtand it; if it had been for our Advantage, to know the preciſe time of our own Death, or of the Final Judgment; if it would have added any whit to our Spiritual Stature, and Growth in Grace; if it would not have much better promoted our Watchfulneſs, and ſerious Diligence, and forwarded our Preparations, to have remained Ignorant, he would not have drawn ſuch a Veil over <hi>that Day</hi> and <hi>Hour:</hi> But would have left it written in fair Characters. But he every way conſulted our Intereſt, and the general Good of the World, by hiding this Knowledge from us. God's Government of the World, and the Magiſtrates influence under God for the Good of Men, would very much be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if every Man did certainly know before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand the time of his Death. Our Uſefulneſs to others would be very much check'd, and the neceſſary Preparation for being ſo, if we knew we ſhould not out-live ſuch a Year, or ſuch a Stage of our Lives. Our Joys and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41795:47"/>Sorrows, with reſpect to our Relations and Friends, would then be immoderate; our Carriage, in Proſperity and Adverſity, would be more unbecoming; our Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God and his Providence, the Redemption of our Time, the Contempt of this World, and the Preparation for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would all be very much hindred by the certain knowledge of the time of Chriſt's Coming to call us to Judgment. Therefore he tells us, <hi>That in an hour we think not of, the Son of Man cometh.</hi> It ſhall be ſuddenly, when he is not expected; and therefore <hi>All</hi> ſhould be <hi>Ready.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſometimes repreſented by the <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Pangs</hi> of a Woman with Child, which may over-take her at a diſtance from her own Houſe, when ſhe looks not for it, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.3. 'Tis ſet forth by the ſurprize of a Thief entring the Window of a Houſe by Night, when the good Man of the Houſe little expected him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Behold I come as a Thief; bleſſed is he that watcheth.</hi> And again we are told, <hi>As a ſnare, ſhall it come upon all that dwell upon the face of the earth,</hi> Luk. 21.35. When Men are careleſs, and ſecure, and confident of Long-life; when they are buſie in purſuit of great things for themſelves in this World, when they are big with mighty Projects and Deſigns for hereafter, when they enlarge their Imaginations to contrive the Satisfactions, they ſhall have for many years
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41795:47"/>to come, in the Pleaſures, and Dignities, and Wealth, which they count upon before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand: when they ſay in their Hearts, <hi>Our Lord delays his Coming;</hi> I have yet time enough to get ready; Then ſhall this day overtake them, <hi>when they think not of it: The Lord of that Servant will come in a day that he looked not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware,</hi> Luk. 12.46.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> and Obligation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ready,</hi> becauſe of the Certainty and Suddenneſs of the Coming of Chriſt. Where I ſhall, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider the <hi>Nature</hi> of this <hi>Readineſs,</hi> and Explain ſomething of it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Shew the Force of the <hi>Argument,</hi> and amplifie it in ſeveral Conſiderations, to urge it the more effectually upon All to make <hi>Ready.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. What is the <hi>Nature</hi> of this <hi>Readineſs?</hi> In the general, it is expreſſed by Two or Three Evangeliſts, under the term of <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> Which, as the ſummary Preparation for the Coming of Chriſt, takes in all the Duties of a Chriſtian, with reſpect to the Affairs of his Soul, and the Everlaſting World; as awaking out of Security, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing our Danger, providing againſt it, carrying it ſuitable to the Expectation of the Appearance of Chriſt from Heaven; Looking for, Waiting for, Praying for,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41795:48"/>Haſtning to, or <hi>haſtning of,</hi> the Coming of the Day of God: It comprehends an awaken'd Heart, an active Faith, a lively Hope, a diffuſive Charity, and perſevering Diligence in all the Fruits of Righteouſneſs: That we may perfect Holineſs in the Fear of God, lay up a good Foundation againſt the time to come, and at laſt lay hold of Eternal Life: That we may have Confidence at Chriſt's Appearance, and be able to ſtand before the Son of Man, with exceeding Joy. This in general under the Name of <hi>Watching,</hi> and being <hi>Ready,</hi> is the Duty of all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Beſides this General Account, we may conſider ſome of the <hi>Particular Metaphors,</hi> under which our Lord repreſents himſelf, (or is ſet forth in Scripture,) when he comes again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> As a <hi>Bridegroom.</hi> And ſo our Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſiſts, in our Accepting him, and Choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him in ſuch a Relation: <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one Husband, even Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.7. And we read of the <hi>Marriage</hi> of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and the <hi>Readineſs</hi> of the Wife, cloathed in <hi>fine Linnen,</hi> which is the <hi>Righteouſneſs of the Saints,</hi> Rev. 19.8, 9.</p>
                  <p>Now if you think you are ready for the Coming of Chriſt, under this Notion, ask your ſelves, Hath there been any ſuch Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between Chriſt and your Souls, which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41795:48"/>the Scripture repreſents by a <hi>Marriage-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?</hi> Have you penitently and thankfully Accepted him for <hi>Yours?</hi> and given up your ſelves entirely to be his? To as many as have thus Accepted and Received him, He gives Power and Priviledge to become the Sons of God. Do you renounce all other Lovers? Do you prefer Him alone, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning all Competitors and Rivals? ſo as <hi>not to be for another,</hi> but <hi>for him,</hi> Hoſ. 3.3. The like we read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.10, 11. <hi>Hearken, O Daughter, and conſider, and encline thine ear; forget alſo thine own people, and thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe. So ſhall the King greatly deſire thy beauty; for he is thy Lord, and worſhip thou him.</hi> Is there a Supream Superlative Correſpondent <hi>Affection,</hi> on your part to him, who hath ſaid, That as <hi>a Bridegroom rejoyceth over a Bride,</hi> ſo will <hi>He rejoyce over Thee?</hi> Iſa. 62.5. Is this expreſs'd by an entire Subjection to him, as the Head of his Church, and the Saviour of his Body? <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.23. And this not for a time only, but for ever, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19. <hi>And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteouſneſs, and in judgment, and in lovsng-kindneſs, and in mercies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The publick Solemnity of this Marriage will be at the Reſurrection of the Dead, when he ſhall come again to conduct his Spouſe to his Father's Houſe, and more fully to evidence his Love, by the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41795:49"/>of his own Glory. Our <hi>Readineſs</hi> therefore for the Coming of Chriſt, implies our hearty Choice of <hi>him,</hi> and Conſent to be <hi>his;</hi> to Love, Serve, Honour, and Obey him with Faithfulneſs, Diligence, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance to the end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Chriſt is repreſented as a <hi>Houſhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and <hi>Lord;</hi> who is gone into a far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and hath intruſted his Servants with various Talents, which they are to employ according to his Order, and trade with for his Service, expecting to be accountable to him at his Return, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.23. Though our Lord be gone to Heaven, he hath left a Family upon Earth, and committed a <hi>Truſt</hi> to every of his Servants. Now our Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Care in the Improvement and Uſe of our Talents, will be our <hi>Readineſs</hi> for the Coming of Chriſt; under theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we are to be Reſponſible to him for all the Bleſſings, Natural or Spiritual, that he hath committed to our Truſt, and we have no Right in them any other way: We are but Stewards, He is the <hi>Proprietor,</hi> and Abſolute Lord. And according to the number and kind of our Talents, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects proportionable Care and Diligence, as good Stewards to manage and improve them. <hi>For to whom much is given, of them much will be required.</hi> Every one hath ſome Talents, ſome Truſt; our Reaſon, and our
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41795:49"/>Health, our Time, our Parts, Reputation, Eſtate, Intereſt, Authority, Power: All the Bleſſings of any kind that we have, are <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,</hi> to be uſed for the Service of our Lord: And <hi>Bleſſed is that wiſe and faithful Servant, who at his Lords Coming ſhall be found to have done ſo.</hi> Our Faithfulneſs and Care herein, is our <hi>Readineſs for his Coming.</hi> For he may demand an Account of our Stewardſhip, when we expect it not, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.2. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we would be Ready, we muſt be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in his Work, and not bury our <hi>Talents in a Napkin,</hi> or waſte our Lords Goods; but be ſound faithfully doing his Buſineſs in the Places and Relations he hath ſet us. In this conſiſts that <hi>Readineſs for his Coming,</hi> that will intitle us to the Bleſſing, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.43.</p>
                  <p>But leſt it ſhould be ſaid, Who can come up to this? Who is able to be always thus diligently Employed? Who then can be <hi>Ready?</hi> Let us therefore,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Diſtinguiſh</hi> concerning this <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs.</hi> There is an <hi>Habitual</hi> Readineſs, and <hi>Actual:</hi> The one of our <hi>State,</hi> and the other of our <hi>Frame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. An <hi>Habitual Readineſs,</hi> which concerns our State: When our Peace is made with God, ſo that ſhe ſhall be <hi>found with him in peace,</hi> at the Coming of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41795:50"/>When we have ſo put on the Lord Jeſus, as at the Great Day we ſhall not be found <hi>naked,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3. When we are intereſted in the attoning Sacrifice of Chriſt, ſo as to be reconciled to God, and ſhall find Mercy of the Lord in the Great Day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. Perſons of this Character will manifeſt in their Courſe and Carriage, that they expect the Coming of Chriſt, by walking in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Denying all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs, and worldly Luſts, they will live Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godly in this World, as thoſe that look for the bleſſed Hope, and glorious Appearance of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Christ,</hi> Tit. 2.12, 13.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe all that are Ready as to their <hi>State,</hi> and as to their general Courſe, are not ſo as to their <hi>Frame,</hi> therefore Conſider,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is an <hi>Actual Readineſs,</hi> as to the Diſpoſition of the Heart; which upon the near Proſpect and Approach of any Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Chriſt, to call us out of the World, is a Chriſtian Duty. This <hi>Actual Readineſs</hi> we ſhould all endeavour after: That we may have greater degrees of that Readineſs of Mind, and Preparedneſs of Spirit, to Obey the Summons and Call of Chriſt, tho' it ſhould be with very little Warning; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prepar'd, and Willing to go to him whenſoever he ſhall call: <hi>I am ready</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to be bound at Jeruſalem; yea,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41795:50"/>to Die there for the Name of Chriſt,</hi> Acts 21.13.</p>
                  <p>All holy Perſons (though <hi>Habitually</hi> ready) do not reach this: Some cry out with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Lord remove thy ſtroke from me! ſpare me a little longer!</hi> Pſal. 39. Or as <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he received the Meſſage of Death, <hi>turn'd his face to the wall, and wept,</hi> Iſa. 38. But if we have Warning of the Approach of Death, we ought to ſtir up our ſelves <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> to Prepare, to trim our Lamps, and ſet our Souls in Order, reviewing our Lives, renewing our Repentance, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing our Graces, exciting our Hopes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting our paſt Experiences, getting our Evidences ready, and the Promiſes on which we may venture our Souls in a dying Hour; that we may ſay with old <hi>Simeon, Now let thy Servant depart in peace:</hi> And with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, I have finiſh'd my courſe, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth a Crown of Righteouſneſs is laid up for me:</hi> And with our Lord himſelf, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit:</hi> Or with Holy <hi>Stephen, Lord Jeſus receive it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſtians!</hi> Are we not too Unready, the beſt of us, as to Frame and Actual Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Do we ſit as looſe from this World, and all the Perſonal and Relative Comforts of it, that accommodate the bodily Liſe as we ſhould? Have we conquer'd the Fears of Death, and familiarized the Thoughts of the Grave, to that degree as we ought? Is
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41795:51"/>our Love to Chriſt ſo ſprightly and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that we could heartily welcome any Meſſenger to call us to him? Be the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> will, and the Manner and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of our Departure as God ſhall pleaſe, and the Warning never ſo ſhort and ſudden? Are we ready to go preſently, at the firſt Call? That were it not for doing Service in our Places, (which God, who needs not our Help, can do by other ways,) we ſhould rather chooſe <hi>to be with Chriſt, as far better.</hi> Could we Anſwer to ſuch a Call of God, as <hi>Samuel, Lord, here I am, thoudidſt call me?</hi> O let me paſs through the dark Valley! that nothing may keep me longer at ſuch an uncomfortable diſtance from my Lord and Saviour, <hi>that where he is, I may be, to behold his Glory.</hi> This <hi>Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Habitual and Actual, we have need to look after; becauſe <hi>the Son of Man comes in a time when we think not of him.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                  <p n="2">II. To urge your Diligence and Care to be <hi>Ready</hi> for the Coming of Chriſt, let me amplifie and enforce the Argument in this Text, by ſeveral Conſiderations. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That <hi>whether Ready, or not Ready, e're long our Lord will come.</hi> Our particular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Death, which ſhall confine us to the eternal and final one, is at no great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41795:51"/>We are haſtning to this Day of God, whether we believe, and mind it, or no: As Paſſengers in a Ship, to the end of their Voyage, whether they ſleep or wake: whether we be wiſe Servants, or fooliſh; faithful Stewards, or unfaithful; whether we expect the Coming of our Lord, and Prepare for it, or do not: <hi>He will ſhortly come,</hi> and call us to an Account. O how ſoon ſhall you and I be gone! What a Change will a few days make in this City, and in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation? We may judge of it, by what it hath made in few years paſt? In leſs than Twenty Years, what Changes in Families, and Churches, and Cities, and Nations? Husbands and Wives parted, Parents and Children, Friends ſnatch'd away out of the Boſom of their Friends: Thoſe we loved, and lived familiarly with, Called before us, and gone home: And we are haſtning after a pace, whether our Readineſs and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration do, or do not, anſwerably haſten. One Relation, and another Acquaintance drops into the Grave: Some are ready, and ſome unready: One Paſtor after another is removed to Heaven, and the Pulpits where they preach know them no more; and others will ſtart up in our rooms, and are preparing to fill our Places, who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any of thoſe, whoſe Funerals you Remember. And after a ſew <hi>Lords's-Days</hi> more, and at moſt after a few Summers
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41795:52"/>and Winters more, you and I ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led likewiſe, whether we be Ready, or not Ready.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>When once thou art called to thy particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Judgment by Death, nothing more can be done to get Ready for the Coming of Chriſt,</hi> Eccl. 9.10. John 9.4. What, if you were now leaving this World? and how near and ſure is ſuch an hour! You would then be ſenſible, that <hi>now</hi> or <hi>never</hi> is the time to prepare, and get Ready. Awake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and Mind it without delay, that you may not cry for more Time, when time is gone; and for the mercy of God, when it is too late. O how ſhall my unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Soul Appear before my God! How ſhall I paſs into Eternity unready! What ſhall I do, to meet my Lord with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort! as if you had never heard till that time, that you muſt dye, and come to Judgment. O what Hearts of ſtone have Sinners, that can hear theſe things ſo often, and not reſolve without delay to get Ready! That will not conſider the Judge is at the Door, his Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at their back, his Wrath purſues their ſins, and woe be to them if it overtake them. Before their Friends have laid their Bodies in their Graves, or wrap'd them in their Burying cloaths, their Souls ſhall feel, that God is in earneſt, and that <hi>now</hi> is the only time to get ready for Judgment.</p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:41795:52"/>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>When men think not of it, and leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his Summons, the Lord doth often come.</hi> When thou art moſt regardleſs of Death, thy Head and Heart taken up with other things, the Hand-writing on the Wall may appear, and ſtrike thee into a ſit of trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; a Voice from God may be heard, <hi>Come away</hi> Man, or Woman! <hi>Come away,</hi> thy Time ſhall be no more; this Evening, or the next Morning, this Night, or the next Day thy Soul ſhall be required of thee. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, no Place, no Age, no Time, no Portion of thy Life, is certainly exempted. Do not then put off thy being Ready, leſt thy Reſolutions for hereafter ſhould bare longer date than the time of thy Life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>All the Time of our Lives is little enough, to get Ready for the Coming of Chriſt.</hi> 'Tis little enough to learn to Live, ſays the Moraliſt, it is ſhort enough be ſure to learn to Dye. Ask thoſe who have taken moſt Pains, and ſpent moſt of their Time to get Ready: Yet after all their Prayers, and Tears, after all their Watching Striving, Running, and Preparedneſs, they complain they are <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nready</hi> ſtill; unready for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Coming of Chriſt, when they are to meet him at his Table; much more <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> for his laſt Coming. Therefore <hi>let us give Diligence, that we may be found of him in Peace, without ſpot, and blameleſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:41795:53"/>
                  <p>And if the queſtion be ſeriouſly ask'd of all of you, one after another, ARe you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Death? are you Ready for the Coming of Chriſt? or are you not? How few will have the Heart, or Face, to ſay they are? The beſt will ſay, they need further Preparation: But what muſt they think, and ſay of themſelves, who own they are habitually, as to their State un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; no way ſit to Dye? I cannot ſay my peace is made with God: I have not yet enter'd into Covenant with him: I have not ſubjected and yielded my ſelf to Chriſt: I have not taken on his Yoke, or I have caſt it off, after I took it on: I am yet a Stranger to him, or I have ſhameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left him after ſome Acquaintance? And will you put it any longer to the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when your Lord may call within an hour?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>God is now ready to Aſſiſt you by his Grace, if you will awake, and Mind your Work; but if you delay, he may juſtly refuſe, and withdraw it.</hi> And if once the caſe comes to that, you can no more make Ready for Death and Judgment, than if you were already dead; it being as poſſible for us to Repent without life, or after we are dead, as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent without Gods Grace, while we are liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Therefore they that promiſe for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they ſhall Repent, and Prepare for the coming of Chriſt, (ſome time
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41795:53"/>hereafter they reſolve they will) they muſt not only promiſe for themſelves, but for God too; that he will wait their lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and dance attendance after them through all the Stages of their Delays; and yet be as ready to aſſiſt them hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as now; otherwiſe it is as uncertain, whether you ſhall Repent <hi>hereafter</hi> if you live, as whether you ſhall live to that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, wherein you ſay you intend to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Conſider, <hi>How great and Important a thing it is to Dye, and to meet the Lord our Judge.</hi> It is ſo even for good men that are <hi>habitually Ready,</hi> after ſuch a life of ſenſe, and the deep Impreſſions we are under by ſenſible Objects, after our many Backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and actual Sins; to look into the Houſe of darkneſs, and think of lodging there; to lay down theſe Bodies, to corrupt and Putrifie there; to bid adien to all our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and take a ſolemn leave of all our Friends; to think of paſſing thro' this dark Entry, through which as we go right or wrong, we are made or undone for ever; to think of the Majeſty, and Holineſs of God, his Truth, and Juſtico; to conſider the ſtrictneſs, and Spirituality of his Holy Law, and the awful Solemnity of the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Judgment, that all Mankind muſt come under: Theſe and ſuch things
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41795:54"/>conſider'd, which are obvious to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering man, make it no eaſie matter <hi>to dye,</hi> even for the beſt. But for an unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Soul, that is Unready as to his State, who hath done little or nothing, ever in his whole Life of ſuch Work, no Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions can deſcribe the Terrors of that mans caſe; eſpecially for careleſs, carnal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, that attend the preaching of the Word, and are deceived by the Devil, to think they are in the way to Heaven, while yet they live in ſecret Sin, and are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God; what killing diſappointment will they meet with, one moment after Death? when they expect with the fooliſh Virgins, to enter Heaven, and find the door to be ſhut.</p>
                  <p>Sirs, believe and tremble! If you are not ready for the Coming of Chriſt, you are ready for his condemning Sentence, and ripe for Ruine. If you are not ready, as Veſſels of Mercy prepar'd for Glory, you are ready, as Veſſels of Wrath, fitted for Deſtruction. That Place and Portion which you are fit for, you ſhall have at Death. If you are not fit to be with Chriſt, if you are <hi>not made meet for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Saints in Life,</hi> if you are not formed, and wrought by the Spirit of Chriſt, for this ſelf-ſame thing, you ſhall have another Place, and Company, and Portion, with the Devil and his Angels, in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41795:54"/>unquenchable Fire, where is weeping and wailing, and gnaſhing of Teeth for ever.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>You need not fear that you ſhall haſten your Death, by Thinking of it, and being Ready.</hi> Chriſts Summons will not be haſtened, tho' thy Preparation be. The ſtroke of Death will not be ſooner, but the eaſier, and make Life, and Death it ſelf ſweeter, by now endeavouring to be Ready. You will not then be afraid of every Sickneſs, and threatning Danger that brings you to the borders of the Grave. They were the <hi>foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Virgins,</hi> who were affrighted at the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night cry, <hi>The Bridegroom cometh,</hi> becauſe their Lamps were out, and they had no Oyl; they were ſtruck to the Heart, their Hopes dyed, and they preſently ſunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Deſpair. But of ſuch as are Ready, we find them ſpeak of Dying as of an eaſie ſleep; <hi>I muſt put off this Earthly Tabernacle ſhortly,</hi> ſaith one Apoſtle; <hi>The time of my Departure is at hand,</hi> and <hi>I am ready to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd up,</hi> ſaith another, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6. But as Chriſt will not delay his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tho thou be unprepared, ſo neither is thy Readineſs for Death, a likely means to ſhorten thy Life.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Conſider, <hi>It is for this end, that our Lives are continued, and all the mercies of our Lives, that we may be ready.</hi> What have you Life given you for? why were not you
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41795:55"/>cut off many years ago? but that you might have Time and ſpace to Repent, and Prepare for the Coming of Chriſt? How many years have ſome of you been ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? It may be twenty, thirty, forty, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years? and yet after all you <hi>are not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> What have you been buſie about all this while? How have you employed your Time? What is the end of God, do you think, in all the merciful helps He concinues you? Such as Miniſters, and Books, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Providences, your own Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and others Funerals? You loſe the benefit and uſe of all your Mercies of Life, Health, and Time, and ſome of you of Wealth and Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons you have heard, of all the Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial warnings of God to Awaken you: you have loſt them all, if they have not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered your Readineſs, for the Coming of Chriſt: And if you ſhall live many years to come, you muſt ſay it was all <hi>loſt Time,</hi> and wiſh you had never had an hour of it, while this preparation for Death and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is neglected.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Conſider <hi>the unſpeakable Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a prepared and unprepared Soul, in a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hour.</hi> The one is going to ſee the things he hath Believed, and poſſeſs that which he hoped for, and hath the promiſe of God, that he ſhall enjoy. The other
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41795:55"/>is going to feel, what he would not in time believe; to endure the threatned Wrath, he would not Fear, ſo as to eſcape. The one is come to the end of all his Prayers, and Patience, Labours, and Sufferings: The other, to the end of all his Eaſe, and Pleaſure, Mirth and Joy. The one hath the promiſed Felicity, with God, and Chriſt, and all the bleſſed Spirits above, in view before him; the other hath Death and Hell, the Judgment of Chriſt, and an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Miſery before him, ready to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm his Soul. The one can look back with Comfort, and reflect upon his upright Holy perſevering Obedience, mixt with Repentance for many Sins and Failings, and yet can hope in God for his acceptance thro Chriſt; the other muſt review his Heart and Life with horror and regret, and read over the black <hi>Items</hi> of his care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Impenitent Courſe, with Bitterneſs and Torment, and the fears of greater. The one is leaving this World, where he ſpent his days in preparing for Eternity, (thô he heartily laments, that he began no ſooner, and minded it no more;) the other is paſſing into the inviſible Eternal World, for which he hath made no proviſion. The one by Death ſhall be tranſlated to a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed State of Holinefs, Love, and Peace, in the everlaſting joyful Praiſes of God, his Maker, Redeemer, and Sanctifier; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41795:56"/>ſort are paſſing into the Regions of Darkneſs and Deſpair, among Devils, and unholy miſerable Souls, with whom they muſt dwell, under the Hatred and Curſe of God, and the unſpeakable Terrors of his Wrath for ever: O the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one that is <hi>ready,</hi> and one that is <hi>unready!</hi> when the Summons from Chriſt ſhall come to call them both away. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, endeavour to be Ready; for the difference between one mans Death and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers, depends on the difference between Heart and Heart, Life and Life, Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Unpreparedneſs.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Conſider, that all the Readineſs you now can get, will be little enough to ſupport your Souls, when Chriſt ſhall call.</hi> Our utmoſt Diligence to Prepare will not be too much, to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us chearfully to commend our Souls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of Chriſt, in expectation of all the great and glorious things, which he hath Purchaſed, Revealed, and Promiſed. Then all the Grace you have treaſured up, will be little enough, for that is a time to uſe it, not to get it. Our ſtrongeſt Faith will hardly be ſufficient; the cleareſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of our Acceptance with God, will be no more than needs; the moſt apropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, particular, applicatory Faith, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth,</hi> will be little enough to give us confidence in a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41795:56"/>Hour. You know of none can help you, if then you cannot look to Chriſt with hope. If the Devil ſay, this ſinful Soul is mine, and Chriſt diſown thee, and ſay ſo too, what ſhall overcome the fears of Death? No wonder if Doubts and Fears ariſe, from the weakneſs of our Grace, our Negligence and Remiſneſs in the ſervice of God, our Folly and Offences, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Backſlidings, our familiarity with this World, and natural Love of Life, no wonder if it be difficult to conquer all theſe. And how can that be done, if we be not now diligent to get Ready?</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Conſider for your Encouragement, that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs and Sincerity ſhall be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as your habitual Readineſs.</hi> We are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a merciful Covenant, and ſerve a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Redeemer: we find by the parable of the wiſe and fooliſh Virgins, that tho the former, who had Oyl in their Veſſels, had many faults; (for they ſlumber'd as well as the Fooliſh, when they ſhould have been actually waking, and Watching,) yet they were not ſhut out of Heaven: and then your conformity to Chriſt ſhall be compleat, and your weak imperfect Graces ſhall be perfected.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Remember this alſo, that <hi>if your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Preparation be a difficult Work, it is but
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41795:57"/>for a little while.</hi> The allotted ſeaſon to Watch, and Work, and Wreſtle, to ſtrive and run, and uſe all Diligence to be Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is not long. And Chriſt may ſay, <hi>Will you not watch with me one hour? that you may lift up your heads with Joy at my appearing, and then dwell with me for ever?</hi> O how ſoon will the labour of Repentance, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſelf-denying Diligence in our prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Work be all over!</p>
                  <p>Soon will all the Affairs of humane Life be over; all theſe little things which men call <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> be paſt and gone; thoſe, I mean, of Trade and Money, of Farms and Merchandize, they will all be over e're it be long: So will the Difficulties and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of holy ſerious Diligence, in making ready for the Coming of Chriſt be over too. Now we muſt Fight and Wreſtle, and hold on unto Victory, but the time of Triumph is approaching: Now we muſt watch, and ſtand upon our guard, but the promiſed everlaſting Reward, and Reſt, is not far off: Now our Life is, or ſhould be, a Life of Prayer, e're long we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the full Anſwer of all our Prayers, and all our Enemies be under our feet, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Diſturb, or Tempt, or Diſquiet, or Indauger us more for ever. It all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon our ſincere and perſevering Diligence, to get ready for the Coming of Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:41795:57"/>
                  <p>The Improvement, which may be made of this, ſhall be, <hi>Firſt,</hi> To Lament our great and manifeſt unpreparedneſs for this Coming of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Many ſuch as are truly ſanctified, and have Oyl in their Veſſels, are yet too <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nready,</hi> for want of frequent believing Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, concerning <hi>this Coming of Chriſt,</hi> and for want of <hi>Actual Preparation</hi> for it. How many are intangled with the Cares, and Hurry of worldly Affairs, to that degree, that they do not take Time enough, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and bethink themſelves of the glorious Appearance, and Revelation of Chriſt from Heaven, and ſo their Faith is weak, and their Preparation flow. Alas! we are but <hi>too unready,</hi> our unmortified Affections to earthly things, and unbecoming Fears of our luſt Enemy, do plainly prove it. The many breaches between God and our Souls, by particular backſlidings, tell us we are <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nready.</hi> The vanity of our Minds and Spirits, diſcovered by an undue conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to this World, ſhows that we are <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> The exceſs of our Paſſions, upon Worldly Loſſes and Diſappointments, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it too plainly. The declenſion of live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hope, unto which we are begotten and born by Regeneration, the grieving and quenching of the Holy Spirit, as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption, and Earneſt of our Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41795:58"/>ſhow that we are yet too unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                  <p>The Promiſes, on which we muſt venture our Everlaſting Hopes, are not ſtudied, and underſtood, digeſted, and applyed, as they ſhould be, and therefore we are not Ready. Our Deſires of the Coming of Chriſt, our Prayers for the haſtning of it, our anticipated Joy in the fore-thoughts of it, are ſo low, and ſo imperfect, to what they ought to be, that they prove we are <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nready.</hi> We do not Labour and Watch, Pray, and Hope, with a reſolved perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Zeal, and Conſtancy, for the <hi>Grace that is to be brought to us, at the Revelation of Chriſt,</hi> as thoſe that are <hi>Ready</hi> for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis further to be bewail'd, that <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes fancy, and ſuppoſe they are ready, when indeed they are not.</hi> O how great is the number of ſuch! who imagine themſelves to be too well prepar'd already, to learn to Prepare. And therefore all the Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Exhortations of the Word, make no impreſſion on them, becauſe they think themſelves not concern'd, tho they have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accepted Chriſt, as the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> of their Souls, by an humble, penitent, unfeigned De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of themſelves to him, to love, pleaſe, and obey him above all. And their own Conſciences (if they would conſider, reflect,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41795:58"/>and ſearch) muſt tell them, that they are not <hi>Faithful Stewards</hi> of their many Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, as expecting to be call'd to an Account.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The general <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconcernedneſs of the moſt, about any ſuch thing as this being Ready, ought greatly to be Lamented.</hi> The moſt reckon it at that diſtance, they will not trouble themſelves to enquire whether they be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd, or no. Others are conſcious of their own Unreadineſs, and therefore do not care to think of Dying: Tho they know not how ſoon they may be called; for many younger, and more likely to live, have dyed this laſt Year. Parents may ſurvive their Children, and lay thoſe little parts of themſelves in the Grave, before they make their own Beds there: Yet ſuch is the powerful craft of Sathan to befool the Sinner, and ſuch the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Sin to harden the Heart, that ſome of the moſt unprepared, make a ſhift to live in peace, tho they cannot tell but Death may open the Door into Eternity the next moment. They will not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, and apply it to <hi>their own caſe;</hi> they will not know, that <hi>their Judge</hi> is at the Door, that <hi>their</hi> Day of Reckoning is at hand, that they are haſtening to the Tribunal of Chriſt, that <hi>their</hi> Judgment lingereth not, and their Damnation ſlumbereth not. One would wonder, what Apprehenſions, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41795:59"/>Thoughts of theſe things, ſuch careleſs Chriſtians have, who durſt not ſay they disbelieve, or deny the Scripture Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet feel no correſpondent Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions anſwerable to the Nature, Weight, and Tendency of ſuch things.</p>
                  <p>Let me ask thee, O man, that haſt neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected hitherto to make Ready: Doſt thou think, that Chriſt will receive thy depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul at Death, or no? Will he acquit and own thee in the Judgment, or no? What ſay'ſt thou, haſt thou enquired, and examined, and made it thy buſineſs to know this? and to make ſure of it? How is it, that thy Mind is fill'd with other Thoughts? thy mouth with other Talk? and thy Time employed about other things? when thou art ſo near to the final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, and ſeeſt ſo many Souls daily paſſing into another World; and yet wilt not conſider what ſhall become of them, and of thy ſelf: but wilt continue to purſue ſome tranſitory Pleaſure, or Profit, while God and Heaven are neglected, and Chriſt deſpiſed, his Favour loſt, and thy own Soul loſt, or in the extreameſt danger of being ſo, becauſe thou art <hi>not Ready.</hi> Canſt thou think that Chriſt will <hi>then</hi> accept thee, if thou <hi>now</hi> neglect him? Canſt thou hope, that he will prove himſelf a Lyar, by own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as he hath often declared he never will? O pity your ſelves in Time! that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41795:59"/>you may not be denyed his pity at laſt. The door of Grace is yet open, but how ſoon, how ſpeedily may it be ſhut! if now you will not enter. O what an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mercy is the offer from God, that <hi>yet you may</hi> enter! what would departed Souls, that dyed Unready, give for ſuch a Call of God? Hold a little, Tremble, and Believe, and delay no longer.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Direction,</hi> in the general, Since the Bridegreom will come, and it may be in an hour when you do not look for him, ſee that you have Oyl in your Veſſels, and Lamps, as thoſe that wait for the Coming of their Lord. If thou haſt no Oyl, buy it; if thou haſt, burn it; if thou haſt no Wedding Garment, get one; if thou haſt, put it on; if thou haſt no true Love to God, never leave till the Holy Flame be kindled; if thou haſt any in truth, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and uſe it, as one that expects the Coming of Chriſt. More particularly,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Seek <hi>Reconciliation</hi> to God, by a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Dedication of your ſelves to God in Chriſt, accepting him as offer'd in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and reſigning, and yielding your ſelves unfeignedly, and without reſerve, to be his.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let the Work of <hi>Mortification,</hi> both as to Sin and the World, be progreſſive,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41795:60"/>and conſtantly carried on, that you may be <hi>found of him in Peace,</hi> as to your State; and <hi>without Spot,</hi> as to your Frame, as well as <hi>blameleſs,</hi> as to your Converſation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14. Sit looſe in your Affections from Earthly things, that Death may not rend and tear you from that, which hath the chiefeſt poſſeſſion of your Hearts, for then you cannot meet the Summons of Death, but with an exceſſive Sorrow.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Be much in <hi>Self-Examination,</hi> that you may get over your Doubts and fears, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your Adoption, and attain to a more well-grounded Hope, and Aſſurance of the ſpecial Love of Chriſt. What will it avail us, to think we are Pardoned, and ſhall be ſaved, and e're long to find our ſelves miſtaken when there can be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy? You muſt <hi>now</hi> underſtand your danger, if ever you will be ſaved from it. And we have the ſame Rule and Law given to judge our ſelves by, that God will judge us by at laſt. Therefore retire, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your ſelves, whether you can obſerve the Seal and Earneſt of the Spirit of Grace upon your Hearts; whether you can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view your Converſation and Courſe, as tranſacted in ſimplicity and godly Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as in the ſight of God, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the ſame Spirit? whether this ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Spirit hath drawn out your Deſires
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41795:60"/>after Holineſs, and your Love to God, his Word, his Worſhip, and his Servants, ſo as to wean you from the World, and make you place your Hopes and Happineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, chooſing God for your only Portion and Chriſt for your Teacher, Saviour and Lord; enabling you to live with ſincere Deſires, and Endeavours to pleaſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, in the believing expectation of what he hath purchas'd and promiſed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Hopes of it before all the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and Advantages of Sin, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life. And if upon ſerious ſearch, your Hearts condemn you not, you may have confidence towards God: But how can you know theſe things without Examining? and how can you have this confidence, without ſuch a Knowledge? and how can you think of the Second Coming of Chriſt with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, without ſome ſuch good Hopes thrô Grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. You ſhould likewiſe, Endeavour to carry it in every <hi>Relation</hi> and <hi>Condition,</hi> as expecting to be called to an Account, when your Lord ſhall come. Do nothing now, but you would be willing to hear of then; nothing that you would be aſhamed, or afraid to have ript up, opened, and diſcovered in that Day. Think with your ſelves often, Is this that I am now doing, the Life which I now lead, the Deſigns
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41795:61"/>that I now purſue, ſuch as will be ſweet, or bitter to be remembred, when Chriſt ſhall come? will it be to my Shame or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to my Joy or my Confuſion, in the Day of Reckoning, when I muſt ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Judge? How many Temptations to ſin might this repell? How many neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Duties might this awaken us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, eſpecially toward <hi>Relations?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may now be a terrible thought to ſome of us, to conſider and foreſee that thoſe of our <hi>Relations</hi> whom we moſt tenderly Love, are like to fall under the condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sentence of Chriſt, and periſh Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. You can hardly bear up now under the weight of ſuch a thought: will you not then awake, to Counſel, Warn, Reprove, Exhort, Admoniſh, and Intreat them, and do all you can to prevent it? But if they will not hearken, your Faithfulneſs ſhall be your Comfort, and their Condemnation ſhall not diminiſh your Happineſs, tho' it will aggravate their Doom if you have done your Duty. I will inſtance in <hi>one Relation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suppoſe a Wicked Child, to behold his Parents on the Right Hand of the Judge, (one or both of them) owned by Chriſt, rejoycing in his Love, and taking part with him, ſo as to be pleaſed with the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his Righteous Sentence, without any ſuch Bowels of Pity toward them, as
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41795:61"/>now they feel: And if we could imagine them to diſcourſe together, how might Holy Parents mind them of the various Methods they uſed to prevent their Ruine; and of all the Counſels, Reproofs, and Prayers, with which they follow'd them from year to year. <q>I begot thee, or brought thee forth; I laid thee in my Boſom, I carried thee in my Arms; I took care of thee in Infancy; I inſtructed thee in Childhood; I look'd after thy Education; I brought thee to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies; I put thee upon Secret Prayer; I warn'd thee of thy Danger by bad Company; I urg'd thee to flee youthful Luſts; I told thee what would be the End and Iſſue; I forewarn'd thee of this day; and of the Everlaſting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that Chriſt had Threatned; and of thy too late Repentance in the other World; and that hereafter I ſhould ſee thee condemned to Hell, without being able to pity thee. And <hi>now the Caſe is thus,</hi> I cannot but approve the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sentence of the glorious Judge; for thou wouldeſt not prepare, and get Ready for this Day, notwithſtanding thy many Warnings and Calls from God and Man to do it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, 5. Labour to ſtrengthen <hi>Faith</hi> concerning the <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Glory of Chriſts
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41795:62"/>Appearing,</hi> and the moſt important awful; <hi>Conſequences</hi> of it, both to the <hi>Righteous,</hi> and to the <hi>Wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to <hi>the Certainty of his Coming.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief is at the bottom of our neglect to make Ready. We do not conſider the confirming Reaſons of the Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and beg the Light and Influence of the Spirit, to perſwade us fully of this foundation Article. We take up with the name of Faith, and do not Believe; with a notional weak, ineffectual Faith, that may dwell in the Hearts of Hypocrites, or Devils; and therefore feel no influence by it to excite our Hopes, or Fears, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
                  <p>Did we indeed believe it, as an unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable Truth, <hi>that Chriſt ſhall come again to judge the World,</hi> we could not but Fear to be found Unready: For whatever the diſtance be between this and that, Our Faith would repreſent it <hi>near,</hi> as if the thing were preſent; as if we ſaw the Redeemer in the Clouds, with the glorious Retinue of Bleſſed Angles, and ten thouſand of his Saints: It would realize the Solemnity of his Tribunal, the Books being opened, and the Wicked trembling before their Judge, and the Righteous juſtified, and rejoycing in the Approbation of their Saviour.</p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:41795:62"/>
                  <p>Did we believe it <hi>Certain,</hi> we ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten put the Queſtion, How ſhall I appear and ſtand in the Judgment? How ſhall I give an account of all my Talents? What ſhall I anſwer when I am call'd to his Bar? what ſhall I do to be befriended, when I am tryed for my Life? Therefore beg that God would fix a believing ſence of this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Hearts, that your Faith may be <hi>the Evidence of things not ſeen:</hi> That you may believe it as firmly, as if Dooms-day were already come, as if you heard the Trump to ſound, and that Amazing voice, <hi>Ariſe ye Dead, and come to Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Strengthen and increaſe Faith, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Glory of the Second Coming of Chriſt,</hi> as well as the <hi>Certainty</hi> of it. He ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from Heaven, with viſible Glory in flaming Fire, with his mighty Angels, ſo that every Eye ſhall ſee him, and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that pierced him. He ſhall come again <hi>with Power and great Glory,</hi> and the voice of the Arch-Angel ſhall awaken the World, and fill them with an awful Reverence of their Glorious Judge. He that ſtoopt ſo low at firſt, to be cloathed with a mean diſguiſe, and to glorifie the Father in the form of a Servant, by the Sacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for our Redemption, ſhall be publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Honoured in the view of all Mankind.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41795:63"/>At his firſt Appearance he was a <hi>Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief,</hi> he made himſelf of no Reputation, was <hi>deſpiſed and rejected of men;</hi> but he ſhall come again, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to vindicate himſelf from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his Enemies: <hi>Every knee ſhall bow before him, and every Tongue confeſs him to be Lord:</hi> And they who affronted his Throne, and lift up the Heel againſt him, ſhall be made his Footſtool. At firſt he appear'd with all the ſinleſs Infirmities of Humane Nature, but ſhall a ſecond time with all the Demonſtrations of the Divine Power, and Godhead.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How awful and important will be <hi>the Conſequences</hi> of his Coming to all Mankind?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To the Wicked.</hi> With what Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Confuſion, with what Fear and Horror, with what Dread and Trembling, ſhall they, as guilty Priſoners, be made to ſtand before his Judgment Seat? What killing deſpair will ſeize their Hearts? what Paleneſs and ſhadow of Death will cover their Faces? what Convulſions, and gripes of Conſcience will then torment them? Where can they go? where can they hide? How can they appear? How can they avoid appearing? What can they ſay? How can they anſwer the Charge? or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41795:63"/>the Accuſation? or evade the Sentence? or put off the Execution for a day? or bear it for a Moment? Since they can never eſcape the Tryal, or corrupt the Judge, or be pardon'd after Judgment, or get the Sentence to be reprieved, or the Execution deferr'd. It will <hi>then</hi> be in vain to cry for Mercy, for now the Day of Vengeance without Pity, and of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Mercy, is come: what Friend wilt thou go to then? where are they? who can plead for thee, or ſave thee, but he that will not? I would not for ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Worlds, appear in thy Caſe, among thoſe that ſhall then be found <hi>Naked,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nready.</hi> And are not theſe things ſit to be now conſider'd, believ'd, and prepared for? What is all the Buſineſs and Affairs of this World? What but a Play, a Game, a Trifle, to theſe things?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>To the Righteous.</hi> The Bridegrooms departure is not upon a Divorce: He ſhall come again, to be glorified in his Saints, and be admired of all them that believe. They ſhall ſee him and meet him in the Air, and ſay, <hi>Yonder is He</hi> whom our Souls Love; yonder is the bleſſed Jeſus, who once came from Heaven, to dye for us, and now comes to bring us to Heaven: we believed his Word, and behold now he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41795:64"/>comes to make it good. They ſhall hear his abſolving Sentence; their Perſons ſhall be juſtified; their Cauſe ſhall be pleaded; their Sins ſhall be blotted out; their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and Sorrows ſhall all be ended. They may therefore rejoyce in hope, and lift up their Heads in expectation of that Day; for the bleſſed Sentence ſhall raviſh their Hearts, when they ſhall be bid to <hi>Enter into their Lords Joy:</hi> And hear thoſe endearing Words, from the great Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Come ye bleſſed Children of my Father, take Poſſeſſion of the Inheritance prepared for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us therefore pray for the Second Coming of Chriſt, and the haſtning of it, as all Believers under the Old Teſtament and New, have done. And in this poſture, Watching, Praying, Waiting, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for his laſt Appearance to <hi>Judgment,</hi> we ſhould <hi>be Ready</hi> for his particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us by <hi>Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly, Let us improve every Warning of Divine Providence,</hi> every <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Funeral</hi> of our <hi>Relations,</hi> and <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our own Readineſs to follow. This is the Language of the late Providence that occaſions this Diſcourſe. This is the voice of God, by every breach he makes in our own, or our Neighbours Family. <hi>Be you
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41795:64"/>alſo Ready: for you know not the Hour, when the Son of Man comes.</hi> We loſe the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and Holy Lives of our deceaſed Friends, for want of Imitation; and we loſe <hi>their Deaths</hi> too, if we be not awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prepare for <hi>our own.</hi> But alas? How ſoon do the Impreſſions wear off, of ſuch awakening Spectacles? It may be the ghaſtly looks, or dying groans of dear Friends, or departing Relatives, gaſping out their laſt breath, and juſt paſſing into the other World, for the preſent may affect us a little: It may be when we ſee an open Coffin in our own Houſe, or a Grave gaping to receive the Body of one we knew, and loved, and lately converſed with, this may move and ſtartle us a little: It may be when we behold the mournful Looks, and Habit, the Funeral Pomp and Solemnity, that attends them to the Houſe of Darkneſs, ſome ſerious Thoughts are excited; our Minds are aw'd into ſome reflections upon our own Mortality. But when the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is over, and we are gone from ſuch a Spectacle; when the Dead are buried out of our ſight, and we engag'd among the living World again, how ſoon alas! is all this forgotten? and how few are Gainers by ſuch a Loſs, in the manner they ſhould be, <hi>i. e.</hi> To take the Warning, <hi>to be Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Prepared for the Coming of Chriſt to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41795:65"/>us,</hi> which is as ſure, as if we were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy dead.</p>

                     <hi>One Help to get</hi> Ready <hi>our Selves for</hi> Death <hi>and</hi> Judgment, <hi>is to conſider and improve the Death of</hi> Others. <hi>Either of ſuch, who were called, and not</hi> Ready, <hi>whoſe caſe ſpeaks loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to us not to delay, and trifle as they did: or of ſuch as were</hi> Prepared, <hi>and fit to Dye, their Death hath alſo the like voice of that in the Text,</hi> Be you alſo Ready. <hi>Our Deceaſed Friend, Mrs.</hi> Gearing, <hi>I am perſwaded was of this latter ſort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <p>§. 1. <hi>I Know very well, that the praiſing of the Dead hath been ſcandalouſly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as a more cloſe way of flattering the living Relations, and therefore would be cautious what I ſpeak on ſuch Occaſions: But the Honour of Gods Grace is not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Honour of thoſe, in whom it did remarkably appear: and he hath promis'd, that they who ſerve, and follow him, ſhall be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To mention what was really imitable and praiſe-worthy, needs no Apology, or Excuſe; the matter carries its own Juſtification.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 2. <hi>You of this Congregation could not but obſerve her Diligence and Conſtancy in attending
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41795:65"/>on the Publick Worſhip of the Lords Day, and to ſhow forth the Lords Death every Month, in the other Solemnity of the Supper. Her</hi> early At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance <hi>here, before the publick Worſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, thô ſhe liv'd at a more remote diſtance than many of you, is not unworthy of your Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 3. <hi>Her ſtrict Seriouſneſs in</hi> Family-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>and</hi> Cloſet Duties, <hi>by which the Life and Vigour of practical Godlineſs is to be kept up, they who knew her beſt, were well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 4. <hi>There was one thing in her daily Courſe, which ſhould ſhame and awaken moſt Profeſſors,</hi> viz. <hi>the Conſcientious daily practice of</hi> Self-refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>and</hi> Examination; <hi>reviewing and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over the paſſages of every Day in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. She made Conſcience every Night, to look back on the Duties ſhe had performed, and the Manner of 'em; on the Mercies ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd; on the Errors, Weakneſſes, and Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſhe had been guilty of,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in order to</hi> Repentance, <hi>or</hi> Thankſgiving. <hi>Oh that there were more of ſuch, concerning whom this may be truly ſaid! We ſhould be more Ready for the Table of the Lord every Month, and more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the preſence of Chriſt at the Hour of Death, if we did thus review the Actions of every Day, at the cloſe of it.</hi>

                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:41795:66"/>
                     <p>§. 5. <hi>Not to inſiſt upon her Faithfulneſs, and Prudence, Tenderneſs and Affection, Affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and Friendly Carriage in every Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with divers other things very Commendable in her Life. I ſhall only take notice of a few things concerning</hi> her laſt Sickneſs, <hi>which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ten days determin'd in Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 6. <hi>Her</hi> Patience, Submiſſion, <hi>and</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation <hi>was anſwerable to the other part of her Character and Deportment; that is, truly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. When ſometimes (by intervals) her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper did affect her Head, as ſoon as ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the uſe of her <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and a compoſed mind, very pertinent and earneſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to Heaven, diſcovered the holy Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of her Heart and Frame. When ſhe could hardly ſpeak more than</hi> Yes, <hi>or</hi> No, <hi>yet ſhe did ſufficiently ſignifie her Aſſent, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Approbation of any ſeaſonable Religious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that was made to her.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 7. <hi>She owned her</hi> Hope <hi>and</hi> Truſt in the Mercy of God, thro' Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Eternal Life; and under the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of ſo painful and violent a Feaver, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd ſhe had Peace within.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 8. <hi>The day before ſhe dyed, ſhe told a near Relation, that ſhe had a great work to do on the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41795:66"/>morrow: And when it was replyed, that 'tis true,</hi> It is a great and difficult Work to dye; yet one moments Enjoyment of God in Heaven will make amends for all: <hi>She very affectionately cries out,</hi> I, ſo it will: I know that my Redeemer lives, and that I ſhall go to him, and be with him.</p>
                     <p>§. 9. <hi>The Evening before her Departure, after I had prayed for her, in the preſence of ſeveral Relations and Friends, and ſeriouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to commend her Soul into the hands of Chriſt; I ask'd her, Whether</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>were not the Chiefeſt of ten thouſands to Her; whether ſhe did not deſire and prize him above all; whether ſhe had not given up her ſelf to him, again and again, with all her Heart and Soul, entirely, and without reſerve; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd (humane Infirmities, and Backſlidings repented of, excepted) to walk and live as a Follower of Chriſt, under the Conduct of his Spirit, and according to the Rule of his Word, and ſome other ſuch Queſtions, that might aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt her to diſcern the Truth of her Grace,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>She anſwered in the Affirmative, with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Modeſty, Humility, Thankfulneſs and Affection: And gave me her hand at</hi> Parting, <hi>with thanks for my Prayers and Aſſiſtance, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of God the beſt of Bleſſings for me and mine, which were her own words.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:41795:67"/>
                     <p>§. 10. <hi>After which, in a difficult ſtruggle with the King of Terrors, we hope and truſt ſhe was ſupported by the Everlaſting Arms of that Powerful Grace of Chriſt, who hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd Death, and him that had the Power of it, the Devil. So that we may now ſay,</hi> O Death where is thy Sting, <hi>&amp;c. God grant thoſe lively impreſſions of Death, and another World, which the Relations then preſent ſeem'd to have on that occaſion, may not eaſily wear off, or loſe their proper Influence!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And now,</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>let us mix our Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows for our Deceaſed Friend, with the Joys of Faith, on the account of her being made meet and ready for the Preſence of Chriſt. Some Sorrow is allowable, were it but as Death enters into the World, as the fruit of Sin: But ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Prepared for Death, <hi>and made meet for the Promiſed Bleſſedneſs, beyond the Grave, that ought to be the matter of</hi> our Joy, <hi>which we believe is ſo of</hi> hers. <hi>And do we not our ſelves Hope, (and have we any better, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Thing we hope for, than) to poſſeſs that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs with Chriſt, which we believe ſhe is poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of? Is it not then unreaſonable, to make that the Subject of immoderate Mourning, and exceſſive Lamentation,</hi> as to our departed Friends, <hi>which is the principal matter of Hope and Comfort,</hi> as to our own Souls? <hi>And ſhall
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41795:67"/>we for the ſake of a</hi> leſſer good, <hi>which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to our ſelves by their living longer, deſire to deprive them of a</hi> Greater, <hi>which they cannot attain but by dying? Let us rather be awaken'd, edifi'd, and encourag'd by their Examples, who by Faith and Patience, and Perſeverance, are gone to inherit the Promiſes: and by their</hi> Funerals <hi>be excited to foreſee and make Ready for</hi> our own. <hi>Oh that the Call of God, by this Breach among us, may be underſtood and obeyed! For this it ſpeaks to every one in particular,</hi> Be you alſo Ready. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>THe ſad Occaſion of the <hi>Sermon,</hi> and your Relation to <hi>Her,</hi> whoſe Dying Requeſt was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in my Preaching it, doth ſtyle the Dedication yours. Though what I have mention'd of your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Daughter,</hi> is leſs than others would have ſaid on the ſame Subject, yet having given an Account of her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredneſs and Willingneſs to Dye, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks that ſhould be conſidered as a ſufficient Argument to mitigate your Sorrow, and prevent its Exceſs. 'Tis the Apoſtles Inſtruction <hi>concerning them who ſleep in Jeſus,</hi> that <hi>we ought not to ſorrow as do others, who have no hope.</hi> Such were the <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> and 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
<pb facs="tcp:41795:71"/>of them, that <hi>they</hi> mourned long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the death of old <hi>Jacob,</hi> than his own Son <hi>Joſeph</hi> did. I know the <hi>Time of her Death</hi> gives an Accent to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity: That before your Mourning Weeds were laid aſide for one of <hi>the beſt of Husbands, who hath a good Report of all Men, and of the Truth it ſelf;</hi> you ſhould be forced to continue the ſame, or put on more, for the <hi>Loſs</hi> of <hi>ſuch</hi> a Child, in the <hi>Prime</hi> of her Youth, and Strength, and Beauty: <hi>A Loſs</hi> for which you do not mourn alone, ſince many others are partners of your Grief; not by ſympathy only, as pittying you, but from a due Reſpect and Affection to her, and their own Concern at her Departure.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>as your Afflictions abound, God can make your Conſolations by Chriſt abound much more:</hi> And ſuch Loſſes as theſe, (though ſome of the ſmarteſt and moſt afflictive to humane Nature) may turn to your Spiritual Gain: And even <hi>this Rod,</hi> like that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> may bloſſom, and produce the <hi>peaceable Fruits of Righteouſneſs:</hi> If in the want of their Company, God himſelf be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
<pb facs="tcp:41795:71"/>on as <hi>your All in all:</hi> If their removal out of this World promote your Mortification to it; if their being taken up to Heaven, aſſiſt your Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and excite your Deſires to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: God hath already made good his Covenant Promiſe, in a very peculiar manner, to thoſe whom he <hi>gave,</hi> and hath <hi>taken</hi> from you; and I truſt will do ſo as to thoſe who remain: that they may <hi>know and ſerve the God of their Fathers with a perfect Heart, and ſee the Felicity of his Choſen;</hi> That they may tread in the ſteps of their departed Relatives, and bear up the Name of God in their reſpective Stations; to his Glory, and your Comfort, and their Salvation. And if God ſhould not <hi>make your Houſe to grow, yet he hath made an Everlaſting Covenant with you, well ordered in all things, and ſure,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.5.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh the following Diſcourſe may contribute any thing to your Support: or at leaſt be accepted, as an Expreſſion of my Obedience, in complying with your requeſt thus to make it publick: And as a Teſtimony of my unfeigned
<pb facs="tcp:41795:72"/>Reſpect to the <hi>Memory</hi> of the <hi>Deceaſed</hi> with a ſerious deſire of ſome benefit to others alſo, by ſuch a <hi>remarkable Inſtance</hi> of an <hi>Early Piety,</hi> of an <hi>Exemplary Life,</hi> of a <hi>peaceable Death:</hi> Which <hi>God grant,</hi> who alone can bring Good out of Evil; all whoſe Works are perfect, and whoſe Wayes are Judgment.

                  <p>
                     <hi>I Being Earneſtly deſired, both by the</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations <hi>of the Deceaſed Gentlewoman, and by the</hi> Preacher <hi>of the following Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sermon, to Teſtifie what I knew of the Gracious and wonderful workings of the Holy Spirit upon the Heart of this Perſon during Her Life; I could not but yield to their Importunate Requeſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And upon this Occaſion I muſt declare, That having Known her from her</hi> Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, <hi>and having very much obſerved her</hi> Converſation <hi>of late, and being called to give her ſeveral Viſits in her</hi> ſickneſs, <hi>I do believe (upon the whole) that God did give her a</hi> ſound Repentance <hi>for, and a</hi> Full Remiſſion <hi>of all her ſins, through the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I can aſſure thee,</hi> Reader, <hi>who ever thou
<pb facs="tcp:41795:73"/>art: that ſhe had an awakened</hi> ſight of her ſins, <hi>accompanied with a great meaſure of</hi> Godly Sorrow <hi>for them: I diſcerned alſo in her a</hi> deep Humiliation, <hi>and I heard her open her</hi> ſelf-Condemnation <hi>thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I found in her alſo a clear Knowledge of the Nature of the Now</hi> Covenant, <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a Right Apprehenſionof the Nature of that</hi> Faith, <hi>which is required of all men, (and is through Grace beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſome Penitents) whereby the Soul doth attain to an Intereſt in that Covenant: It being, thereby, united unto Chriſt; and</hi> conſequently, <hi>doth partake of the Benefits of his</hi> Merits, <hi>and doth receive the Fruits</hi> of his Atonement, <hi>with the Inhabitation of his</hi> Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saving Faith and True Repentance are alwayes inſeparable; and their Conjunction doth evidence and</hi> ſpeak <hi>them to be true and ſaving; both Theſe (I do believe) were united in the Soul of this deceaſed Perſon: And therefore I have very great Hopes of her State. All</hi> Faith <hi>which is pretended to, where</hi> Repentance <hi>is wanting, I account to be nothing but a preſumptuous Confidence: and all ſeeming Repentance, which is not Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſome Faith in the Divine
<pb facs="tcp:41795:73"/>Goodneſs, and in the promiſes made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (by our Lord Jeſus) is no other than the Repentance of a</hi> Cain, <hi>or a</hi> Judas <hi>his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Our Lord Jeſus did (as it were)</hi> Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize <hi>the whole Goſpel, and</hi> comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>the whole Duty of Man in two words,</hi> viz. Repent and Believe: <hi>and 'tis to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that theſe</hi> two <hi>are ſet in the very Front, as the Text to all his Miniſtry,</hi> Mark 1.15. <hi>And by</hi> reaſon <hi>of the Import of them, they may be accounted as the Contents of the whole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Where theſe two Graces are not conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Guilt <hi>Remains, and</hi> Sin <hi>Reigns: But where they are united in any Soul, as that</hi> Perſon <hi>is</hi> Juſtifyed, <hi>ſo that</hi> Heart <hi>is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly changed, and that Nature is in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> Sanctiſied; <hi>and the Life of that Man (for the future) will be proportionably, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally Holy. Would the Genius of the preſent Age allow me to uſe Metaphors in Soul-concernments, I ſhould think that I did then beſt explicate to vulgar Capacities the Nature of ſaving Faith, when I did call</hi> Faith <hi>the</hi> Daughter <hi>of Knowledge, the</hi> Siſter <hi>of Repentance, and the</hi> Mother <hi>of Love; for the Holy Ghoſt tells us, that Faith comes
<pb facs="tcp:41795:74"/>in by</hi> Hearing, <hi>Ro.</hi> 10.17. <hi>That it Purifies the Heart,</hi> Acts 15.9. <hi>and works by Love,</hi> Gal. 5.6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That God had given this Perſon the True Seed of ſuch a Faith, was evident by its</hi> Fruits: <hi>The Apoſtle tells us, that</hi> he <hi>that hath</hi> not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his, <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.9. <hi>And alſo he tells us, that</hi> as many are led by the Spirit are the Children of God, <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Now I muſt profeſs that (ſo far as I was able to Judge) I have ſeldom ſeen a dying perſon, manifeſt more of a Chriſt-like Spirit than ſhe did: That is, I never ſaw more of a Spirit</hi> Thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>after Communion with God, of a Spirit more</hi> contemning <hi>the World, of a Spirit more deeply</hi> bowing <hi>unto the Will of God, or a Spirit more</hi> patient <hi>under the Croſs; and more</hi> Submitting <hi>to the Rod of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Indeed I knew once a Perſon that did</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>her herein, and it was her Renowned Father:</hi> A Man of the greateſt and moſt deſerved Name, <hi>for Piety and Sincerity, for Humility and Patience, of all Men, in or Near the City, that I have known: Who Feared no Pain or Torture upon any</hi> other <hi>account, but</hi> this <hi>only,</hi> viz. <hi>Leaſt they ſhould tempe him to the leaſt</hi> unbecoming <hi>Groan,

                     <hi>The</hi> Submitting <hi>of our</hi> Wills <hi>to Divine Will and</hi> Pleaſure <hi>in all things, is the</hi> ſumme <hi>and</hi> ſubſtance <hi>of all</hi> Practical Religion <hi>here; and the full</hi> conſorming <hi>of our</hi> wills <hi>to the divine</hi> will <hi>and</hi> mind, <hi>is the</hi> height <hi>and</hi> Top <hi>of all mans</hi> Happineſs hereafter: <hi>To enjoy</hi> this Priviledge <hi>of full Conformity</hi> to God, <hi>is the Portion of</hi> None <hi>in this World; and to perform that</hi> Duty <hi>of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to him, is the Attainment of but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Few; <hi>yet this deceaſed Perſon was ſo great a Favourite, as that God was pleaſed to beſtow</hi> this rare Jewel <hi>to be worn in her Boſom, who did ſeem with</hi> John <hi>to Lye ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near the Heart of her Saviour.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:41795:75"/>whom God doth do good with his</hi> whole Heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.41.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As God doth ſuffer moſt men to make their own</hi> choice, <hi>and doth beſtow upon them what they do fully and Finally</hi> chooſe: <hi>ſo he will himſelf chooſe as he will, and he will do with his</hi> own gratuitous favour <hi>as he himſelf pleaſeth; and he will give no account to</hi> any <hi>of his</hi> own <hi>matters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A great Inſtance hereof was this</hi> now <hi>bleſſed perſon, of whom I may ſay, that her</hi> whole Life <hi>was full of Gods</hi> goodneſs: <hi>and that</hi> Mercy <hi>and</hi> Truth <hi>did follow her even all her</hi> dayes; <hi>which</hi> dayes, <hi>the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Heaven would not ſuffer to be</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; <hi>becauſe it did ordain, that her</hi> Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows <hi>and her</hi> Temptations <hi>ſhould be but</hi> Few.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Time being nothing but a</hi> dreſſing Room <hi>to Eternity; the</hi> ſhorter <hi>it is, the</hi> ſooner <hi>do Holy Souls enter into the more</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate <hi>preſence of the Glorious Majeſty.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>It is Reckoned in holy Writ, as an act of</hi> very Great kindneſs <hi>ſhewn by</hi> Hegai <hi>(the Kings Chamberlain) unto</hi> Eſther, <hi>that all things neceſſary for her</hi> Puriſication, <hi>and for her due</hi> preparation, <hi>for the love of her</hi> deſigned <hi>Husband</hi> (The great King Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuerus,)
<pb facs="tcp:41795:75"/>
                     <hi>were given to her</hi> more ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>than to others: whereby a</hi> Quicker <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the King was afforded her; and the Crown was ſo much the</hi> ſooner <hi>ſet upon her Head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The good Spirit of God did deal</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>after the ſame manner, with this</hi> young Virgin: <hi>For the work of Sanctiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was</hi> haſtened <hi>in her, that she might the more</hi> early <hi>receive the Crown of Glory, from the</hi> King of Kings: <hi>and might be preſented holy and without ſpot, or blemish, or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Few pages, and fewer hours allotted me for this work, will not permit me to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the many</hi> ſpecial <hi>favours that were</hi> ſhoured down <hi>upon this perſon</hi> while ſhe lived.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I shall not therefore take notice of the priviledges of her</hi> Birth, <hi>or the Honour of her</hi> Family, <hi>which were great; neither will I mention her Natural endowments, of</hi> parts, <hi>or</hi> Beauty, <hi>or any ſuch thing: Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, that ſhe her ſelf (though young) had learned</hi> before her death, <hi>to reckon ſuch enjoyments as theſe, to be very mean and poor, when compared with the</hi> Joys <hi>that were ſet before her.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>They are Love tokens of a greater</hi> value, <hi>which I did obſerve to be conferred upon her; and theſe were</hi> ſuch <hi>and</hi> ſo many, <hi>That I may ſay that ſhe was one of thoſe that</hi> God had bleſſed with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly things in Chriſt: <hi>and I may adde with the Apoſtle, that God</hi> having choſen her in him before the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World, to be holy and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Blame. <hi>And the ſame God having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the</hi> End, <hi>did alſo ordain the Means.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Accordingly, in the</hi> Firſt place <hi>the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God appeared in</hi> ordering, <hi>that ſhe ſhould be</hi> born <hi>of, and</hi> brought up <hi>by very Pious and Religious Parents; and few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons did ever enjoy more Spiritual</hi> Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>and</hi> Admonition, <hi>or had a greater ſtock of Prayers laid up for them, than this Gentle voin in and the reſt of that Oſſspring.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another ſingular Mercy, which did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote her Salvation, was the excellent</hi> pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, <hi>of modeſty, virtue, and piety which was afforded her by her elder Siſters. The Inſtlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a</hi> Good Example <hi>is alwayes greatly</hi> Advantagious: <hi>but when it is found in near</hi> Relations, <hi>'tis much more obliging and efficactous.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Another great Bleſſing,</hi> much conducing
<pb facs="tcp:41795:76"/>
                     <hi>to her Eternal Happineſs, was this, that in her</hi> youth, <hi>ſhe enjoyed the priviledge of Attending upon</hi> ſuch an eminent Mim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; <hi>that the very</hi> Enemies <hi>thereof, have been heard to</hi> Confeſs, <hi>that it is very</hi> Learned, <hi>and moſt</hi> Rational, <hi>and</hi> further <hi>they knew not: but ſuch as are</hi> Taught of God, <hi>and have their</hi> ſpiritual ſences ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, <hi>ſo as to be acquainted, not only with the</hi> form of Godlineſs, <hi>but alſo with</hi> the Power thereof, <hi>theſe men do ſay, that the Character which the others do give of this eminent perſons teaching, are moſt true; and they do further alſo ſay, that it is</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Clear <hi>and</hi> convincing, moſt Evangelical <hi>and</hi> Scriptural; greatly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical and profitable, <hi>and yet</hi> very Sublime <hi>and</hi> Spiritual.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now Reader conſider, whether</hi> many (if any) ſuch <hi>have finally miſcarryed; whoſe</hi> Natures <hi>were</hi> gentle, <hi>and eaſie to be</hi> entreated; <hi>whoſe</hi> hearts <hi>were</hi> Soft <hi>and</hi> Tender; <hi>who had the Beneſits of ſuch</hi> Education, <hi>and ſuch</hi> Example; <hi>who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed ſuch Teaching</hi> abroad, <hi>as well as ſuch Counſel at</hi> home; <hi>and all, accompanyed with</hi> fervent Prayer <hi>unto God for a</hi> Bleſſing, <hi>which I am ſure that ſhe did not want: it being
<pb facs="tcp:41795:77"/>reported of her Father, that his Cuſtom was (with the Pſalmiſt,</hi> 119.164.) Seven times a day to pray unto the Lord, and to praiſe him. <hi>Moreover, I am informed, that this</hi> deceaſed Gentlewoman <hi>was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to ſpend much time in</hi> Cloſet Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>of</hi> late; <hi>conſider then, I ſay, whether we may not</hi> hope conſidently, <hi>that the Grace of God had</hi> ſavingly <hi>and</hi> effectually <hi>wrought upon her; who was both viſibly</hi> in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>with God; and whoſe heart alſo God had</hi> diſpoſed <hi>and</hi> prepared, <hi>by ſuch ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Means of Grace which he had beſtowed upon her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And this is yet</hi> more evident, <hi>if we</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect <hi>upon God's dealing with her in</hi> her laſt Sickneſs; <hi>whereby God did ſeem</hi> to ſeal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction <hi>deeply upon her Soul. Her diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was one of the worſt ſort of Small Pox: At her firſt being taken, ſhe had ſtrong appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions that ſhe ſhould dye; ſhe therefore did fall cloſely upon the work of</hi> Examination, <hi>deſiring the aſſiſtance of ſome</hi> Miniſters <hi>therein; and ſhe was viſited by many; ſhe opened her caſe to us all, and God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make her to ſuſpect and be jealous of the worſt; and to confeſs, and condemn her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for, her Sins, both of Omiſſion, as well

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41795:80"/>and confirm the Profeſſors of the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith,</hi> and to propagate and promote <hi>it</hi> even in the Court of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And if Chriſt might be magnified, he was perfectly indifferent to Live or Dye; (<hi>v.</hi> 19, 20.) <hi>For to me to live is Chriſt, and to dye is gain,</hi> v. 21. His Life, he hop'd, might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Honour of Chriſt; and his Death would be ſubſervient to the ſame deſign: By his further ſervice if he live, and by his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings if he dye; by his Miniſtry ſuppoſing his Life, and by his Martyrdom in caſe of his death.</p>

                     <hi>But if I live in the fleſh, this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is the fruit of my labour,</hi> v. 22. or, it is worth my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to glorſie the Redeemer by continuing in this World. <hi>Yet what I ſhall chooſe I wot not. For I am in a ſtrait betwixt two, having a deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To <hi>Depart,</hi> or be diſſolv'd: The Original word is uſed both by Chriſtian and Heathen Writers for a departure from any place to return home, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.36. And when the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks of his approaching death, he tells us, that <hi>the Time of his departure was at hand,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Having a deſire</hi> to depart, a vehement and earneſt deſire, as the word imports; and <hi>to be with Chriſt,</hi> to be <hi>abſent from the Body, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.8. with that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful <hi>Saviour,</hi> who had compaſſion on me,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41795:80"/>when as an ignorant Blaſphemer, I perſecuted his Members; <hi>who</hi> call'd me to be an Apoſtle, and enabled me by his Grace to own his Truth in the face of Dangers, and hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto comforted me in all my Tribulation. I deſire to depart, that I may be with <hi>him. With him,</hi> not with the <hi>bleſſed Angels</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Saints,</hi> though their Society will make a part of the heavenly Joy: Not the <hi>former,</hi> they are but miniſtring Spirits and menial Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants employed under him; and though they ſhine as <hi>Stars,</hi> yet <hi>he</hi> is the enlivening <hi>Sun,</hi> from whom they derive their Luſtre, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their glory. Not the <hi>latter;</hi> they have no Bleſſedneſs but by his Donation and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, no Crowns of Life but what <hi>He</hi> puts on. Therefore 'tis not to be with them only or chiefly, that made them thus groan to be diſſolv'd, thus earneſtly deſire to depart, but <hi>to be with Chriſt: Which is far better,</hi> ſimply and in it ſelf more deſirable, <hi>by much more better,</hi> the Comparative being double in the Greek Text; <hi>and yet I wot not what to chooſe, for I am in a ſtrait betwixt two. On the one hand,</hi> his Love to the <hi>Philippians</hi> who needed his preſence, (many falſe Teachers being at that time crept in among them,) made him will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to abide in the Fleſh, and deferr his own Felicity for a time upon their account, <hi>v.</hi> 24. But the Glory of Chriſt's preſence <hi>on the other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> and his own unſpeakale advantage by it, made him deſirous of a Departure; and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41795:81"/>therefore though he determines for the <hi>former,</hi> and was content to live, and 'tis probable had ſome ſecret intimation from Heaven, that all his Work in this World was not yet ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh't; yet he grants the <hi>latter</hi> to be ſimply more eligible: <hi>having a deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is far Better.</hi> Which words are not more ſuitable to a <hi>Funeral So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,</hi> than expreſſive of the <hi>dying Thoughts and Temper of our deceaſed Friend,</hi> and were choſen by her as the Subject of my preſent Diſcourſe. That I may comprehend the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Text, according to the deſire of the Dead, for the Benefit and Inſtruction of the Living; let us conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When, and how far, it is <hi>Warrantable</hi> for a Chriſtian to <hi>deſire</hi> Death?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In what reſpects to depart and to be with Chriſt is far <hi>better</hi> than to abide in the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. On what <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may expect a future Bleſſedneſs with Chriſt, after his departure, ſo as to encourage and excite his deſires after it?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whence it comes to paſs, that even thoſe who acknowledge it far Better to be with Chriſt, than to continue in the Body, are yet <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwilling</hi> to depart in order to it? and what <hi>Remedies</hi> are proper to the caſe of ſuch?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>Application</hi> of the whole, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with reſpect to the ſad Occaſion of our preſent Meeting.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. When and how far is it <hi>Warrantable</hi> for a Chriſtian to deſire to be diſſolv'd? This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry may be anſwered in the following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our <hi>Diſſolution</hi> and Departure as a <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>penal evil,</hi> as contrary to Nature, or as the Puniſhment of Sin, cannot poſſibly be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a rational Deſire: If God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a long Life as the Encouragement and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our Obedience, and threatned an <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty death</hi> as the puniſhment of Impiety; If it be univerſally true, that the Soul of Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires Union with the Body, and unavoidably dreads a ſeparation from it; If torturing pains, and loathſome Diſeaſes are the uſual Antecedents of dying: If the Corruption of the Body, and it's Impriſonment in the Grave till the general Reſurrection be the certain Conſequent of our diſſolution; We cannot but think of Death as a <hi>matural Evil,</hi> and <hi>as ſuch</hi> decline and fear it.</p>
                  <p>Much leſs deſirable will it appear, if conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the <hi>Wages of Sin,</hi> and the fruit of Gods Diſpleaſure, and the Juſt Sentence of his Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive Juſtice: but how far our diſſolution in this latter Notion of it is changed by the death of Chriſt in reference to Believers, is another queſtion, and will more properly be conſidered under the third Inquiry.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our diſſolution and departure ought <hi>not</hi> to be deſired, <hi>Only as a freedom from Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Evil;</hi> as preventive of preſent ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41795:82"/>or delivering us from it. The Apoſtle doth not mention the uneaſie Circumſtances of a Priſon, or the continual hardſhips to which he was expoſed from the malice of his Adverſaries, as the ground of his deſire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, but <hi>to be with Chriſt.</hi> He knew very well that a Chriſtian may ſerve the end of Gods glory, and be uſeful to others in a ſtate of ſuffering: and therefore when he ſaith in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, <hi>We that are in this Tabernacle do groan being burden'd,</hi> he adds the limitation in the following words, <hi>not to be uncloth'd but cloth'd upon, that Mortality may be ſwallowed up of Life:</hi> not meerly to avoid the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of our abode in ſo poor a dwelling, but to come to the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Building not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.3, 4. Not meerly to find relief and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from our preſent burdens, when through melancholly or diſcontent we are weary of Life: <hi>Job</hi> 7.13. <hi>Jon.</hi> 4.3. when we have ſet our Hearts on ſomewhat we cannot obtain, or ſtruggle with ſome Difficulties we cannot maſter: or are impatient under bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Pains, or quite diſpirited by the ſad proſpect of approaching Calamities; in ſuch a caſe to <hi>wiſh</hi> for Death, and <hi>deſire to depart,</hi> is unbecoming the Character, the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Hopes of a Souldier of Chriſt. Much Ieſs will the Gallantry of a <hi>Roman,</hi> or a <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher</hi> legitimate the deſire of Death, only to prevent Slavery, or avoid Diſgrace, or miſs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41795:82"/>the ſight of an unwelcome object. As <hi>Cato</hi> reſolv'd to dye, that he might not behold <hi>Victorious Caeſar,</hi> whom by all means poſſible he had endeavoured to ruine. And

                  <p n="3">3. We muſt <hi>not</hi> deſignedly precipitate or <hi>haſten our Departure;</hi> nor wilfully neglect any probable means to preſerve our Lives, how deſirous ſoever we are <hi>to be with Chriſt.</hi> We acknowledge <hi>God</hi> as the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of our Lives, and ſhall we preſume to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of what is <hi>his,</hi> without a declaration of his conſent and order to authorize us? Are we bound by the ſixth commandment to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the life of <hi>our Neighbour,</hi> and may we be negligent and careleſs of <hi>our own?</hi> Is not every man nearer to himſelf than any other can be? And is not ſelf-murder a violation of the Law of Nature, and condemned by a general ſuffrage? And can we ſuppoſe it a ſufficient Juſtification of our ſelves, that we profeſs a deſire to <hi>be with Chriſt?</hi> whereas we may not do this or any other evil, though the greateſt good may come of it: <hi>He that haſteth to be rich,</hi> even in this ſence, <hi>ſhall not be innocent,</hi> Prov. 28.16. We muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely devoted to ſerve and gloriſie the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41795:83"/>as long as we live; and rather dye upon the Spot, than quit our Station without the order of our General: and yet we muſt not ſhipwrack our Health, or expoſe our Lives to hazard, without a Warrant from Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A <hi>Sincere</hi> Deſire to be with Chriſt, is conſiſtent with <hi>ſome Fear</hi> of Death, and a reproveable <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwillingneſs</hi> to depart and be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd.</hi> The Example of Chriſt himſelf is uſually urg'd in vindication of a natutal ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive fear of Death, <hi>viz.</hi> the diſcovery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of which he made in his Agony and Prayer in the Garden. A <hi>Socinian only</hi> will aſſert, that therefore he was more affected with the fear of Death than many of the Martyrs have been, becauſe of the exquiſite Temper and tender conſtitution of his Body; and that there was nothing but what was natural and ordinary in his caſe. Whereas he was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with the Wrath of God, and bear the Curſe, and be wounded for our Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> otherwiſe his own Innocency and perfect Reſignation to the will of his Father, and the proſpect and aſſurance of Victory and Reward, would certainly have prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Terrible Agony, and bloody Sweat, and importunate Cries, <hi>that if poſſible the Cup might paſs from him.</hi> However I doubt not, but a Timerous Temper may render ſome Perſons extreamly apprehenſive of the pains of Death, and on that account unwilling to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41795:83"/>depurt, though they are truly <hi>deſirous</hi> to be with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Others through the weakneſs of Faith or overmuch concern in the Affairs of this Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though they grant it unſpekably better to be preſent with the Lord, and have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen it as their Portion and ſinal Happineſs, may yet be loth to paſs through the dark Valley. They cannot joyn with the Apoſtle in deſiring to be <hi>diſſolv'd,</hi> though they can ſpeak it from their very hearts, that they deſire to <hi>be with Chriſt:</hi> And that deſire is ſo far prevailing as to keep them upright, and yet not efficacious, ſo as to conquer the fears of interpoſing Death. How unwelcom was the meſſage of Death to an <hi>upright He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> even then when he could plead his Integrity before the Lord! <hi>he turn'd his face to the wall, and wept,</hi> and beſought the Lord that he might not dye, as is evident by <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.3. 5, <hi>v.</hi> compar'd. But I dare not ſay, his unwillingneſs to dye at that Time, was a ſinfull weakneſs, becauſe he might well be concern'd for the Kingdom after his deceaſe, leaſt the faithful ſhould be ſtaggered, and the People revolt to Idolatry, there being no viſible <hi>Succeſſor</hi> to advance the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo hopefully begun; for <hi>Manaſſes</hi> was not then born, being but <hi>twelve</hi> years old when he began to reign, and we know that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had <hi>fifteen</hi> years added to his Life, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.6.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. Though we deſire to be with Chriſt, we muſt not be <hi>Peremptory</hi> as to any <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Time;</hi> but referr our ſelves to Gods good pleaſure for the ſeaſon of our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Though with <hi>Job</hi> we ſhould be ready <hi>to anſwer, when God doth call,</hi> yet with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Reſignation we muſt expect his ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and <hi>wait till our change come:</hi> Job 14.15. though the <hi>dayes of our appointed Time</hi> ſhould be longer than ordinary. Although in a dutiful obſervance to our Heavenly Father we ſhould be willing to return home as ſoon as he ſhall pleaſe to call us, and the felicity of his Preſence ſhould render it deſireable; yet his Soveraign will, and unerring wiſdom muſt be practically acknowledg'd in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the <hi>Seaſon.</hi> He alone, of whom and to whom are all things, is fit to determine how <hi>long</hi> we ſhall tarry, or how <hi>ſoon</hi> we ſhall depart: even the Light of Nature may teach us this. And therefore, when ever we pray <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> we muſt not limit the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the <hi>Time;</hi>

                  <p n="6">6. Not the Time only, but the <hi>Kind and Manner,</hi> of our Diſſolution muſt be referr'd to God. Some have wiſht for a <hi>Sudden Death,</hi> and others have pray'd againſt it. Some have deſired to dye by one diſeaſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by another.</p>

                  <p>Some holy perſons of a timerous Temper and a tender Body, would chooſe to depart by a <hi>Conſumption;</hi> not only as allowing them a <hi>longer</hi> Time to prepare for Death, but as an <hi>eaſier</hi> kind of Death than ſeveral others: Whereas, beſides the uncertainty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of that diſeaſe, 'tis more than poſſible, that the Languiſhment of that pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſickneſs may be as irkſome and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, as the ſhorter pains of more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſtempers.

                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Our Deſire to depart,</hi> and to be with Chriſt, <hi>muſt not be Raſh and haſty,</hi> but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of many Serious and deliberate thoughts, comparing both ſtates together, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the difference. The Apoſtle knew his duty in compliance with the Will of God, and therefore for the ſervice of his Maſter, and the advantage of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> was willing to Live: But he knew withal, it was far better in it ſelf to depart that he might be with Chriſt, and <hi>as ſuch</hi> he deſired it.

We ſhall ſee <hi>him whom our Souls love,</hi> and reap a Happineſs by doing ſo, bigger than our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Hopes, and far above our higheſt thoughts about it: For <hi>in his preſence is fulneſs of Joy, and at his right hand are Everlaſting pleaſures.</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41795:85"/>And can we imagine, that a Bleſſedneſs, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd by infinite Merit, contriv'd by infinite Wiſdom, and prepared by infinite Power, and beſtow'd at length through infinite Grace, will in any thing be defective? Doth not our Apoſtle deſcribe it <hi>beſt,</hi> by aſſuring us it cannot be deſcrib'd; that 'tis greater than we ever ſaw, beyond what we ever heard, and far above what we can ever think? Doth not the very hopes of ſeeing him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive our drooping hearts? Oh what will be the Glory of that bleſſed ſight! is not the pledge and Aſſurance of it by the Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his holy Spirit exceeding comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Oh what tranſcendent Satisfaction will his preſence give us! We now comfort our ſelves with the Contemplation, and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Diſcourſe of it: and if our dark Faith and our faint Hopes, can give us ſuch a Joyful proſpect of what ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to our diſſolution; into what raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Joy ſhall we enter, by the open Viſion and full enjoyment? Is the encouragement and ſupport of a Chriſtian now, from <hi>his preſence with us</hi> here; and will it not be far better, to to be <hi>preſent with him</hi> above, <hi>to be for ever with the Lord?</hi> When we ſhall never queſtion his Love to us, or doubt of ours to him, but have a full aſſurance of the one, and a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exerciſe of the other?</p>
                  <p>And becauſe our knowledge will be ſtill encreaſing, our flames of Love ſhall ſtill riſe

                  <p>But <hi>to be with Chriſt,</hi> is not only eligible in it ſelf, as expreſſive of our future Glory; but much rather to be deſired, if conſidered <hi>comparatively:</hi> Therefore,</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41795:86"/>How many things are there which we find are wanting, both as to our Accompliſhments and Enjoyments? and how much are we diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, if we look for ſatisfaction from <hi>the luſts of the fleſh, the luſts of the eyes, and the pride of life? which,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is all that is in the world:</hi> 1 Joh. 2.16.

                  <p>Do we not find, that what doth rejoyce and pleaſe us one day, appears with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Face when we view it next? or if we think it would pleaſe us ſtill, 'tis gone e're we are aware, and with all our skill and power we cannot protract it's duration. Do not evil accidents overtake us on a ſudden? and our moſt probable deſigns miſcarry in the birth? as if all things were governed by Chance, and there were no Intelligent Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor to overſee and regulate the Affairs of the World, and the Actions and Conditions of men: Inſomuch, <hi>that the Race is not to the ſwift, nor the Battle to the ſtrong, nor Bread to the wiſe, nor Riches to men of underſtanding, nor Favour to men of skill, but time and chance hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to them all,</hi> Eccl. 11.9.

                  <p>Our Conflict with him is ſo difficult, and the iſſue of the Battel, as to what depends on us, ſo very uncertain; that we are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ready to throw down our Arms, and give up all as Loſt. For though he be a conquer'd and baffled Adverſary, through the Victory which our Captain hath obtain'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; yet we cannot now Triumph over him, as hereafter we ſhall. And is it not far better to abandon <hi>this world, of which he is the God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.4. and get above that <hi>Air of which he is the Prince,</hi> Eph. 2.2. that we may be with Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Moreover, how doth our depraved Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture continually caſt forth mire and dirt? what remaining Filthineſs is there yet to be purg'd? what powerful Luſts to be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſubdued? which indiſpoſe us for Spiritual duties, and derive a damp and deadneſs upon all our Religious Exerciſes; which cool our Zeal, and abate the ſervour of our Spirits in the ſervice of our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; which weaken our Conſidence in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſhame our faces before the Lord in

                  <p>Do we not complain of our Ignorance of Divine Truths, and the bleſſed Myſteries of the Goſpel, notwithſtanding all our means of knowledge? of our earthlineſs and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief? of unbecoming Thoughts of God and holy things? of proud Imaginations and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reaſonings againſt his Works and Word? of languiſhing and imperfect Graces to be recovered and perfected, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> And is it not <hi>better</hi> to be with Chriſt, where that which is imperfect ſhall be done away?</p>
                  <p>Is not God diſhonour'd and provok't, by our frequent Omiſſions and ſlight Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of Duty? do we not reſiſt and quench and ſadden his Holy Spirit? and are we not often griev'd by God's rebukes and frowns, by the wounds and ſmart regrets of our own Conſcience? ſo that we <hi>remember God, and are troubled,</hi> and cry out in the bitterneſs of our Souls, <hi>Hath he forgotten to be gracious, and will he be merciful no more?</hi> Are not our holy Purpoſes inconſtant, and our beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions wavering and unſtedy, and very quickly, very eaſily ſhatter'd by the breath of a ſmall Temptation?</p>
                  <p>Have we not a conſtant Watch to keep over our Hearts and wayes? a perpetual War to manage with the infernal Trinity,

                  <p>Yea, had we no corruption, or Sin, of our own to be delivered from, yet our concern at God's diſhonour by the ſins of others, ſhould make us willing to depart; as much more deſireable than our abode on <hi>earth:</hi> Job. 24.9.

                  <p>But becauſe the Text hath a ſpecial rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and to be with him, is that Bleſſedneſs, on the account whereof 'tis deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to depart; I ſhall only mention <hi>his Death</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> as a ſufficient ground to confirm our Faith in the certainty of being
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41795:89"/>with him, and to excite our Deſires of a departure in order to it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Death of Chriſt.</hi> He hath cancell'd the Hand-writing againſt us, and put away Sin, which is the ſting of Death, by the Death of the Croſs: <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. A <hi>way is now open for us into the holy of holies by his blood,</hi> Heb. 10.19. not for our Prayers, only but our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. He hath wounded the Head of the old Serpent, even by permitting him to bruiſe his Heel, by crucifying his humane Nature, (which was only <hi>Veſtigium Deitatis.</hi>) As <hi>Benaiah</hi> ſlew the <hi>Egyptian</hi> with his own Spear, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.21. Having <hi>deſtroyed death and him that had the power of it, and delivered thoſe who were all their Life-time ſubject to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, through the fear of death,</hi> Heb. 2.15.</p>
                  <p>He hath ſet his foot on the neck of this Adverſary, diſarm'd it of it's weapon, and rob'd it of it's ſting, and aboliſh't the ugli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and poyſon of it. He hath diſmounted <hi>Hell and Damnation from behind him that ſat on the Pale-horſe,</hi> Rev. 6.8. Whether the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> were buryed in <hi>Calvary,</hi> where the <hi>ſecond</hi> was crucified, as ſome affirm, I need not enquire; we know that his Death was our Victory, and his Croſs may be our Triumph; ſince the Devil is conquered, and death Sanctified, and the Grave perfum'd by his burial, ſo that we need not be afraid to lodge in a Sepulchre where our Lord himſelf hath ſlept.</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:41795:90"/>
                  <p>Yea ſince the effuſion of his Blood, there is an amiable ruddineſs in the Face of Death; for that which was the Inſtrument of Juſtice, is now the meſſenger of Peace and Joy, that which was the gate of Hell, is the way to Life. He hath brought <hi>ſweetneſs out of the Strong,</hi> and <hi>meat out of the Eater;</hi> 1 Cor. 3.21. and therefore Death as well as Liſe is reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd in the Inventory of the riches of the Saints. <hi>All things are yours,</hi> becauſe <hi>you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>His Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Exaltation;</hi> his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the Dead not only diſcovers the poſſibility of our Reſurrection, and gives us a <hi>pledge and aſſurance</hi> of it, as declaring the ſufficiency and acceptation of his Sacrifice; that therefore the Dead in Chriſt ſhall live, and with his Dead Body ariſe: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.19. But being punctually effected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his prediction and promiſe, it confirms the Truth of all his Word, and ſeals the promiſe of eternal Life unto all Believers. He hath open'd the Priſon doors, and loos'd the bands of Death, and roll'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the heavy Stones from the Graves of his people; he is now become the <hi>firſt fruits of them that ſleep in Jeſus:</hi> And hath <hi>the Keyes of Death and Hell;</hi> Rev. 1.18. even the two moſt formidable enemies are under <hi>his</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: <hi>who though once he were dead, doth now live for evermore.</hi> And for this very end did God raiſe him up, that <hi>our faith and hope might
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41795:90"/>be in him,</hi> in reference to the Bleſſedneſs of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Life, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.</p>
                  <p>Yea, ſaith the Apoſtle, concerning that, <hi>he raiſed him from the dead, no more to ſee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> Act. 13.34. God ſaid, <hi>I will give you the ſure mercies of David;</hi> or an <hi>Everlaſting Covenant,</hi> which Death ſhall not diſſolve, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. And his being riſen, is the Ground of our Faith and Hope that the Promiſe ſhall be fulfill'd. For the Reſurrection of Chriſt is the evidence of the validity and efficacy of his Death and Sacrifice, and a ſufficient proof, that his precious Blood ſhed upon the Croſs, was the <hi>blood of an Everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> Heb. 13.20. Eſtabliſhing a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and making it truly Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting; for we know that <hi>he is a Prieſt for ever, after the power of an endleſs Life,</hi> Heb. 7.16. And therefore <hi>know,</hi> to our unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Satisfaction, Incouragement, and Joy, <hi>in whom we have believed, and that he is able to keep unto that day, what we have committed to him;</hi> 2 Tim. 1.12. <hi>to perfect what he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun;</hi> Phil. 1.6. <hi>and at laſt preſent us blameleſs before the preſence of his glory with exceeding Joy,</hi> Jude 24. <hi>v.

What is the true reaſon why ſo many of thoſe who acknowledge it far better to be with Chriſt,</hi> yet cannot ſay with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, That <hi>they deſire to be diſſolv'd, that they may be with him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The weakneſs of Faith concerning the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible World, and the future Glory of the Saints,</hi> is the reaſon why ſo many Chriſtians are unwilling to dye. They are very ſenſible of the inconveniencies of their preſent abode; they complain to God and men of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Temptation, and Sin, and they hear of a bleſſed Deliverance from all theſe by Death, and a perfect Felicity in the preſence of the Redeemer after their diſſolution; but <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief makes them ſtagger at the Promiſe:</hi> They are not fully ſatisfied that ſuch a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Glory will be conſequent to Dying. Did they but ſoundly believe the Teſtimony and Revelation which God hath given in his Word concerning it, they would chooſe to be <hi>abſent from the body.</hi> Some of the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Heathens have been deſperate in their Choice of death, only as the Period of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Calamities: but others who were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Conſequence, have yet entertained it with an hearty Welcome: As <hi>Socrates</hi> for inſtance, who profeſs'd, That <hi>he ought not to fear death becauſe he could not tell whether it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41795:91"/>were good or evil:</hi> And ſhall not we who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Grounds and Principles, the greatneſs, and certainty of a future Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs after Death, be as willing to depart? <hi>A confirmed Faith</hi> is therefore neceſſary and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable in the preſent caſe: and the rather, that thereby we may <hi>quench the fiery darts of Satan;</hi> who if he cannot hinder us of our Crown, would rob us of our Joyful Proſpect of it; if he cannot prevent out future Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, would render us dejected in our paſſage thither; if he cannot prevail to exclude and baniſh us for ever from the Preſence of Chriſt, would darken our preſent comfort by the deſire and Hope of it; but more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at the proſpect and <hi>approach of Death,</hi> for <hi>that is his hour, and the power of darkneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But by <hi>this ſhield of Faith,</hi> we may be able to ſtand even in <hi>that evil day</hi> of our diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.11.16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Pains of Death.</hi> They pray that God would haſten his Glorious Kingdom, and bring them to it; and believe it to be moſt eligible to be with Chriſt; yet are loth their own Prayers ſhould be anſwered, and the end and object of their Faith obtain'd, through the diſcouraging apprehenſions they admit of a dying hour.</p>
                  <p>Would we not be with the the Lord, and know him better, and Love him more, and enjoy him fully? and ſhall we ſtick at a <hi>little pain,</hi> as introductory to ſo great a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41795:92"/>A Pain that will ſpeedily convey us to Eternal eaſe and reſt; which thouſands of Holy Souls in Glory have indur'd more of, than we can fear.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe the Agonies of Death are ne're ſo frightful to Fleſh and Blood, <hi>hath not our Redeemer a Rod and Staff to comfort us in the dark Valley?</hi> Pſ. 23.4. Doth he not know what it is to dye, and how much we dread it? doth he not underſtand our weakneſs, remember our frailty, pity our infirmities, and bid us ask for ſupport and Strength? yea, hath he not promis'd, that <hi>when Heart and Fleſh ſhall fail,</hi> that <hi>he will be the Strength of our Hearts, and our Portion for ever,</hi> Pſal. 73.26. Shall ignorant hopeleſs <hi>Heathens,</hi> without God in this world, without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of being with Chriſt in the next, be ſo deſirous of Immortality, as to diſpatch themſelves, and be their own Executioners, to force an eſcape from the Body? And ſhall we reſiſt and ſtruggle, draw back and fear, object, and be unwilling, when our Saviour calls us to endleſs and unſpeakable Felicity? Is not this the laſt Experiment of our Faith, and Patience, and holy Reſolution? the laſt eſſay of our Chriſtian Courage? Are not the antecedent pains of dying the fruit of ſin, no leſs than the throws and pangs of Travelling Women? and are the latter tolerable in hopes of Children, and their own deliverance; and may we not ſupport the Former by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41795:92"/>of a greater and better Hope? Are they at all conſiderable and worthy our fear, if put in the ballance with the promiſed Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſollow on our departure? Are they comparable in the Nature <hi>of Evil,</hi> to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Life they lead us to in the Nature <hi>of Good?</hi> or comparable to the gripes of Conſcience, which unpardon'd Sinners meet with in Life and Death? yea, do we not think them greater, and make them worſe by our fooliſh fears, than moſt do find them? Is not the Sting of Death remov'd, and the Heavenly Manſions prepar'd and promis'd? And is it a reaſonable Requeſt, that God ſhould vary from his ſettled Courſe, and ſixed Law, upon our ſole Account? Will nothing elſe content and pleaſe us, but that Heaven muſt deſcend to Earth, or we be in a moment tranſlated thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to prevent our Pain, and ſuperſede the neceſſity of our Diſſolution, which we fear will be ſo attended?</p>
                  <p>As a proper Remedy in the preſent Caſe, let us ſamiliarize the Thoughts of <hi>Death,</hi> by frequent, ſerious Meditation: Let us view it oftner in our way, that it may not meet us with ſo much Terror at our Journeys end: Let us admit the Thoughts of a Departure with particular Application to our ſelves, and improve the Funerals of our Friends, as a ſeaſonable <hi>memento</hi> that our own is near: Let us lay open the Picture of Death naked to our view, and urge it to our Hearts with the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41795:93"/>infinite Glory that immediately ſucceeds, and take in the Death and Promiſe of Chriſt, as our aſſurance of it. And this will reconcile us more to a Departure, and help to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our unreaſonable fears of Pain and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs antecedent to it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The weakneſs and declenſion of our Love to Chriſt,</hi> is another ground of our Unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>to depart, and to be with him.</hi> To a dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Soul, that is deſtitute of the Love of Chriſt, an <hi>Everlaſting Diſtance</hi> would be more deſireable than a <hi>Local Preſence:</hi> For <hi>that</hi> could not make him happy, he would ſtill be as far remov'd from Bliſs, by being with the Lord, as the Centre of a Milſtone in the bottom of the Sea would be from moiſture. But the Company and Converſe of thoſe we Love, muſt needs be Eligible; and the more we love them, the ſtronger will ſtill be our deſire of being with them, and the more impatient ſhall we be of every delay. And is it not the ſeaſe and ſecret language of our Hearts, <hi>Whom have we in Heaven but Chriſt?</hi> And are we not deſirous to forſake this Earth, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his Preſence? Certainly, the growth, and ſtrength, and exerciſe of Holy Love to Chriſt, would even render our Diſſolution grateful in order to it; and make our Hearts rejoyce at the approach of Death, <hi>as it did old Jacob's, to ſee the Waggons</hi> that are ſent to fetch us to our <hi>beloved Jeſus, who is Lord of that Countrey whither we are going.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:41795:93"/>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Immoderate Love to this preſent World, and our Temporal Life.</hi> Were we crucified to <hi>fleſhly Pleaſures,</hi> and <hi>ſenſual Joys,</hi> to <hi>worldly Honours</hi> and <hi>earthly Riches;</hi> we ſhould leſs regret the Thoughts of Dying, and more heartily deſire <hi>to be with Chriſt.</hi> For as the Pangs of Death are not ordinarily ſo violent and intolerable to one whoſe ſtrength is waſted by a pining Sickneſs, as to him who is Arreſted ſuddenly in his full ſtrength and vigour; ſo will he more eaſily leave this World, who for ſome time paſt hath been dying to it. Were we more <hi>crucified to the World, and the World to us by the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6.14. we ſhould not ſo affectionately hug the Carkaſs of a dead Enemy, whom we our ſelves have crucified and ſlain; but wait for the Time, and long for the happy Hour when we ſhall leave it, and be gone to our Eternal Reſt. Let us therefore make uſe of all the Chriſtian methods of Mortification, and look on this World as a ſtrange place, and our ſelves as <hi>Pilgrims and Strangers</hi> here; as Exiles from our own Countrey, and haſtening to it: And we cannot but wiſh our ſelves at home, and deſire a departure as neceſſary thereto; and in the <hi>interim,</hi> ſigh to think of the vaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion and difference between the ſlender Entertainments of our Inn, and the plentiful Proviſions of our Father's Houſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Blotted Evidences, and the want of Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> concerning our Title to the Heavenly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41795:94"/>Glory. And this we all pretend, as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our Unwillingneſs to Die: A <hi>Sadducee</hi> is loth to die, leſt he ſhould not be at all; an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprepared Sinner,</hi> for fear of being Miſerable; and a <hi>Doubting Chriſtian,</hi> becauſe he knows not whether Happineſs or Miſery ſhall be his Portion after his Departure: For were we well aſſured we ſhould be with Chriſt for ever, we could not be ſo backward and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be diſſolv'd. Had we any better grounds to hope that Sin was pardon'd, and God our Covenant-Father; that Heaven would be our Inheritance, and we ſhould not come into Condemnation; we might rejoyce to think of our departure, when and how it ſhall pleaſe God to call us. When the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> could ſay, <hi>The Lord is my Shepherd;</hi> he could boldly venture upon Death, and walk through the Valley of Darkneſs <hi>without fear of evil,</hi> Pſal. 23.4, 6. But when Diſtreſs had brought his Sin to remembrance, and made him doubt of his Condition, he cries, <hi>O ſpare me a little longer, that I may recover ſtrength, before I go hence, and be no more ſeen,</hi> Pſal. 39.13. Could you ſay with the Spouſe of Chriſt in the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, My Beloved is mine, and I am his,</hi> Cant. 6.3. you might chearfully joyn your <hi>Amen,</hi> when you hear the Spirit and the Bride ſay in the <hi>Revelations, Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly,</hi> Rev. 20.22.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Try your State, and Examine your ſelves a-freſh; and endeavour with your utmoſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41795:94"/>Care and Diligence to obtain a well grounded <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> founded on the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience, by comparing the Promiſes of Remiſſion, and Eternal Life, with the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Qualifications and Conditions of them: For <hi>if our hearts condemn us not, we ſhall have conſidence towards God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.21. even in a dying hour. To which end, let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by daily Acts of Repentance, to obtain a daily Pardon. Let us ſum up our Accounts at the foot of every Page; I mean, reflect every Night, on the Paſſages of the preceding Day; that we may reſt on our Beds with the ſenſe of a daily Pardon, and be as ſit to die as we are to ſleep.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Our fond Affections to our Friends on Earth,</hi> may make us loth to die, though we hope to be with Chriſt in Heaven. But is not his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom more deſirable, than the Arms and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of our deareſt Friends, and neareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations? Muſt we not abandon and <hi>hate them all for his ſake?</hi> Luke 14.26. <hi>i. e.</hi> uſe them as contemptible and hated things, if they keep us from him. Have we not ſolemnly engag'd to do ſo by our Covenant with God? and ſhall we not ſtand to our Agreement? Is there no difference between our <hi>Friends on Earth,</hi> and our <hi>beloved Saviour?</hi> How often is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active Pity vouchſafed in the room of Succour, when <hi>they</hi> need our Aſſiſtance, or <hi>we</hi> intercede for <hi>theirs!</hi> We know, if they are <hi>unholy,</hi> they ſhall for ever be baniſh'd from the Preſence of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41795:95"/>Chriſt; and we may well be aſhamed to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to die on their account: And if they are <hi>holy,</hi> tho' we ſhall not return to them, yet we know that they ſhall ſhortly come to us. And cannot God inſtruct them in his Fear, order their Conditions, diſpoſe of their Affairs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their Comfort, and anſwer all our Prayers in reference to them, after our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? yea, hath he not often done ſo?</p>
                  <p>Have we any Friends on Earth, that are every way ſo accompliſh'd, as alway to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleaſe us? Or are we ſo perfectly wiſe and good, as never to diſguſt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige them? Is there not ſome Selfiſhneſs, Deſign, and private Intereſt; ſome Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, Flattery, and Diſſimulation; ſome Inequality, Unſuitableneſs, or Inconſtancy in our Friendſhips here? Are not the Beſt of thoſe we love, Ignorant and Miſtaken, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, Deceived, Weak and Impotent; and as likely to deſile and grieve us by their Corruption, as to edifie and rejoyce us by their Grace? But hereafter, when that which is imperfect is done away, they ſhall all have ſuitable Qualifications to recommend them to our moſt ſincere and conſtant Affection, and be every way more fit for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Joy. We ſhall then be never weary of each others Company; we ſhall fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand one anothers Mind; we ſhall live in perfect Harmony, and full Satisfaction, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the dread of Abſence, or fear of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41795:95"/>Now if we have ſome Friends, we have many Enemies; but in the preſence of Chriſt there ſhall be <hi>none</hi> but <hi>Friends,</hi> and ſuch as ſhall for ever be <hi>ſo;</hi> their Perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more amiable, and their Society more deſirable than now it can be. Now if we are pleaſed with their Converſe, we may quickly loſe it, and the <hi>deſire of our eyes be taken from us,</hi> by a ſudden ſtroke, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.16. that we know not how to value or love them, till 'tis too late. And ſhall we be unwilling, <hi>on their account,</hi> to <hi>depart, and be with Chriſt,</hi> ſince they are haſtning after us, and after a few days abſence, we ſhall meet them again, and dwell with them for ever?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>Application</hi> remains, which ſhall be only in Four Particulars, as <hi>Inferences</hi> from what hath been ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We may hence take notice of the <hi>great Efficacy and Power of the Chriſtian Faith and Hope.</hi> That notwitſtanding our fondneſs and affection to the Body, and the contrariety of Death to our ſenſitive Inclinations; that yet this Faith and Hope can urge us to deſire a Diſſolution in order to it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may hence inferr, That <hi>the Soul doth not ſleep in the Grave with its Companion the Body, until the Reſurrection,</hi> but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately paſs into a ſtate of Bliſs. For the Apoſtle to abide in the Fleſh, was more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41795:96"/>for the <hi>Philippians: For him to live, would be Chriſt,</hi> Ver. 21. <hi>i.e.</hi> For the advancement of his Glory: How then was it <hi>better to depart?</hi> or in what <hi>ſtrait</hi> could he be, whether he ſhould chooſe a longer Life, or a preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, if no Bleſſedneſs were expected till the Final Judgment? And why doth he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his <hi>being with Chriſt,</hi> as that which made <hi>Death deſirable?</hi> Is not the Preſence of Chriſt with us on Earth, and our ſerving the Ends of his Glory in this World, much more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible than to <hi>ſleep</hi> in the Grave till <hi>dooms day?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Is it <hi>better to depart, and be with Chriſt,</hi> than abide in the Body? Then the Fable of <hi>Purgatory is hereby Exploded.</hi> Were we to be tranſported by our Diſſolution, only from <hi>leſſer</hi> Pains to <hi>greater,</hi> or from a Life of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, to a State of Suffering, (ſuch as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> imagine their <hi>Purgatory</hi> to be, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the Torments of Hell in the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of them, though different in Duration,) how were it far <hi>better to depart,</hi> that we may <hi>be with Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Is it the Object of a Chriſtians deſire, <hi>to depart, and be with Chriſt?</hi> And is that far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to continue in the Body? Then <hi>let us not Grieve immoderately at the departure of thoſe who have obtain'd their wiſh, and enjoy their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Did they long to be with Chriſt, and chooſe to be diſſolv'd in order to it? And is it their unſpeakable Satisfaction that they are ſo?
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41795:96"/>And do we expreſs our Love and Kindneſs to them, by repining at their Felicity? Shall their deſired Repoſe, and Reſt, and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, be our Torment, Grief, and Sorrow? Would we, that contrary to their own well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Inclinations, they ſhould continue longer here on Earth, or return back again from Heaven, meerly to gratifie our fond Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections? Have they obtain'd a ſpeedy Victory after a ſhort Conflict? and receiv'd the Crown of Life, as ſoon almoſt as they begun their Chriſtian Race; the glorious Recompence of Reward, though they had wrought but one hour in the Vineyard, when others muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour twelve? And ſhall we mourn like utter Strangers to the Chriſtian Faith and Hope? Would we delay the Glory of God in their Salvation, and deſer their Felicity in the bleſſed Preſence of the Redeemer; and be content that a Voice ſhould be wanting in the Heavenly Quire, rather than <hi>we</hi> be Sadned by their departure?</p>
                  <p>Would Parents have their Children con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their Swadling-Cloaths? Or when advanc'd to riper Years, wiſh them back again to Infancy, and hinder their Poſſeſſion of that Inheritance which they are born to, and diſpos'd to enter on, and enjoy?</p>
                  <p>Are not you your ſelves haſtning to the Grave, and hope e're long to be with Chriſt? And is it not a refreſhing Thought, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that your <hi>Treaſure</hi> is there before you;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41795:97"/>
                     <hi>with their Father and your Father, with their God and Saviour and yours;</hi> I mean, your Holy Clidren and Friends whom you dearly Love?</p>
                  <p>The Primitive Church was wont to Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the Funerals of Holy Perſons, with ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pſalms and Hymns of Praiſe to God, for their Deliverance and Felicity obtain'd by Dying: And ſhall we refuſe to be comforted, for the Death of thoſe who ſleep in Jeſus, and deſired to do ſo; <hi>as if in this Life only we had Hope in Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Something, 'tis true, of Grief and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, muſt be allow'd to Nature, Duty, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, and Contracted Friendſhip, and the Honour of the Deceas'd; for they are reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd to die miſerable, who are hurl'd into the Grave without the attendance of a Sigh, or Tear, or Funeral Lamentation. But our Aſſurance of the future Glory they poſſeſs with Chriſt, (which they themſelves preferr'd to a longer abode on Earth,) ſhould wipe our Eyes, and prevent Exceſs. We mourn that they are gone, and <hi>deſire their Company;</hi> but we know, they do not wiſh themſelves back again for the ſake of <hi>ours;</hi> no, they are gone to better Friends <hi>above,</hi> than thoſe they have left <hi>below.</hi> And were it not for the weakneſs of our Faith and Hope, in reference to the Inviſible World; were it not for the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power of unmortified Selfiſhneſs, and our immoderate Love of this preſent Life; were
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41795:97"/>it not for the remiſneſs of our Love to Chriſt, and the bleſſed Saints; we could not but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be with <hi>them,</hi> rather than wiſh that they ſhould be longer with <hi>us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore inſtead of an intemperate Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at their departure, let us imitate their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and propound their holy Lives and Deaths as our Pattern and Encouragement.</p>

Making this Bread of Life her daily food, and taſting ſuch ſweetneſs, and reaping ſuch benefit by it, that even at</hi> midnight, <hi>while others ſlept, ſhe would often ſpend ſeveral hours in reading the Bible: Lamenting on her death-bed the loſs of Time by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Books; which could not aſſiſt her to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41795:98"/>underſtanding of her duty, and the Mind of God, or take off her Affections from the Love of this World, and prepare her Soul for the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 6. <hi>Notwithſtanding this ſecret ſerious Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, her</hi> Humility <hi>and</hi> Modeſty <hi>was ſuch, as not to make a great noiſe and ſhow to others, as if the Form of Godlineſs were the principal, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing to be regarded.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 7. <hi>For ſeveral weeks</hi> before her laſt Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>ſhe was obſerv'd leſs to regard the World than formerly; more Seriouſly to be devoted to God; and more to diſlike vain Company, and idle Talk, eſpecially if it carried with it a Tendency and deſign to diſparage others: and in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects ſo to demean her ſelf, as if ſhe had receiv'd ſome ſecret Revelation from God, that her Time would be but ſhort, and her change was near.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 8. <hi>Though before ſhe fell ſick, ſhe was fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enough of that</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">The ſmall Pox.</note> Diſeaſe, <hi>whereof ſhe dyed, yet having taken her Bed, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Diſtemper, ſhe profeſs'd her ſelf intirely willing to acquieſce in the Will of God. And was diſpleas'd with any who would have tamper'd with her Face, or diſcours'd to that purpoſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 9. <hi>Yea during the whole three weeks of her Sickneſs, ſhe continued in ſuch a frame; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the loathſomneſs of the</hi> Diſeaſe; <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Troubleſome Preſcriptions of</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians; <hi>notwithſtanding her own</hi> Pains, <hi>of which her Conſtitution, Breeding and Age conſidered,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41795:99"/>ſhe could not but be very apprehenſive. And with an</hi> admirable Patience and Reſignation to the Will of God, <hi>with a great contempt of the Vanities of the World, and an holy Indifference even to Life it ſelf, ſhe</hi> deſired to Depart: <hi>And that not meerly to be eas'd of her Pain, but</hi> to be with Chriſt, <hi>and the bleſſed Society a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove: or to uſe her own words,</hi> To be with her Heavenly, and her Natural Father: <hi>And gave this excellent reaſon for her deſire; Leſt if reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to health, ſhe ſhould meet with ſome prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Temptations, <hi>that might turn away her Heart from God and Heaven: and therefore ſhe had rather be with Chriſt, than put it to the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 10. <hi>Her</hi> Victory over this World <hi>was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe evident by the particular charge ſhe gave to thoſe about her, to let ſome</hi> young Gentlewomen <hi>of her Acquaintance know from her, how contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible the beſt of this World will be, when they come to dye: and entreat them in her Name, (as her laſt requeſt, and the expreſſion of her ſpecial kindneſs to their Souls) that they would not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſue it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 11. <hi>As an inſtance of her</hi> ſubmiſſion to the good pleaſure of God, <hi>and ſatisfaction in his order; ſhe deſired, that her</hi> Mother, <hi>and the whole Family might joyn with her in ſinging the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the</hi> 39 <hi>Pſalm:</hi> Ver. 9. I was dumb, and opened not my mouth, becauſe Lord thou didſt it. When thou with rebukes doſt correct man for iniquity, thou makeſt his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41795:99"/>beauty to conſume away like a Moth. Surely every man is Vanity. <hi>Selah,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by heart according to the Metre.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 12. <hi>As an inſtance of her joyful</hi> Hope of Glory <hi>in the preſence of Chriſt after death, ſhe made thoſe who attended in her Sickneſs, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to read over the</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. <hi>chap. in the cloſe whereof, the glorious Appearance of Chriſt to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſet forth; and the Happineſs of the Saints deſcrib'd, by</hi> being ever with the Lord, <hi>with this addition,</hi> Wherefore comfort one another with theſe words. <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18.</p>
                     <p>§. 13. <hi>With the free uſe</hi> of her Reaſon, <hi>to the very laſt, God was pleas'd to give her the great Bleſſing of a</hi> Tender Conſcience; <hi>and therefore ſhe did not ſlightly overlook even</hi> little Failings <hi>without a penitent obſervation: and ſome of them ſuch as no man in a judgment of Charity would reckon ſinfull. Every thing that look'd like</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifulneſs to her Mother, <hi>ſhe heartily begg'd her Pardon for; though nothing conſiderable of that kind can be remembred, to make her need for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs: thankfully owning the ſtrictneſs of her Education, the ſeaſonable Reproofs of a diſcreet Parent, and even the abridgment of that Liberty which other young perſons take, (very often to their prejudice and ruine) as a ſingular advantage and favour from Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 14. <hi>In ſome part of her Sickneſs, ſhe had ſome humble becoming</hi> doubts and fears <hi>of her own ſtate; but having imparted them to a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Perſon well acquainted in the Family, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41795:100"/>heard his Reſolutions and Anſwers; ſhe was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſatisfied, and expreſs'd her hopes of Pardon and Salvation through the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt;</hi> who loved her and waſhed her from her Sins in his own Blood. <hi>Yea ſo far was ſhe from que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning the goodneſs of God, and the Truth of his Promiſe; ſo far from doubting of the alſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Chriſts Mediation, the Merit of his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and his willingneſs to receive returning Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: that the believing thoughts of it were her greateſt ſupport and joy; ſaying often in the time of her Sickneſs, That</hi> though her Sins were as Scarlet, God could make them as Snow: though red like Crimſon, they ſhould be as Wooll. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18.</p>
                     <p>§. 15. <hi>Moreover, ſhe did thankfully</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Mercies of God <hi>to her, in the former part of her Life: whereof ſhe had very many, both Perſonal and Relative. And particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that Thanks might be returned to God for his ſingular goodneſs to her during her Sickneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 16. <hi>She was</hi> very deſirous of Prayer to God <hi>on her behalf; and very joyful and well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed when ſhe had it: and being at any time ask't what particular requeſt ſhe deſired ſhould be made to God for her; ſhe mention'd not her Recovery and the lengthening of her days; but the</hi> forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sin <hi>through the Merit of her Redeemer; an humble ſubmiſſion to Gods diſpoſal; and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared heart to acquieſce in his appointment. And ſo in one ſence ſhe was</hi> full of dayes, <hi>though ſhe dyed very young: being ſatiated with the Time ſhe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41795:100"/>had liv'd on Earth; and not importunate for a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſtay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 17. <hi>Within a few hours before her diſſolution, (of the approach whereof ſhe was more apprehenſive than thoſe about her) ſhe was very deſirous that a</hi> worthy Miniſter <hi>whom ſhe named, might immediately be ſent for,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mr.</hi> S. F.</note> to commend her Soul to God: Who accordingly came, thô at Midnight. She her ſelf joyn'd in that last Office, with great ſeriouſneſs and affection; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward return'd him her hearty thanks for his great kindneſs therein, ſaying,</hi> Now I have nothing more to do, but to dye: <hi>Only requeſted him not to leave the houſe that night, as knowing, that his</hi> Company <hi>and</hi> Counſel <hi>might adminiſter to the</hi> ſupport of her Affectionate Mother, <hi>and other Relations, whom ſhe ſhould leave in ſorrow, thô ſhe her ſelf was paſſing to Eternal Joy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 18. <hi>After which ſhe compoſed her ſelf to reſt, and refuſed every thing that was offer'd her to take, making Signs with her hands of her unwillingneſs to be diſturbed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 19. <hi>In that ſhort ſpace of her Continuance, which was not an hour, ſhe was heard to ſay,</hi> Be gone, Satan! Be gone! Thou art a Lyar from the Beginning, and the Father of Lyes. O come Lord Jeſus. <hi>And ſoon after ſhe ſaid,</hi> He is come, he is come: <hi>and ſo fell aſleep, as in the Arms of her deareſt Saviour, or as the Jews report of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>That he dyed with the Kiſs of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O Death! where is now thy Sting? O Grave! where is now thy Victory? The ſting
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41795:101"/>of Death is Sin, and the ſtrength of Sin is the Law: But thanks be to God, who hath given us the Victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>And</hi> bleſſed are the Dead that Thus dye in the Lord.</p>
                     <p>§. 20. <hi>Would to God, that the Account here given, might effectually convince us, of the great difference between the Death of the Holy and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nholy, of the Righteous and the Sinner! Might convince us of the great Bleſſing of</hi> holy Parents, <hi>and a good Education; and encourage Parents to be diligent and faithfal, to be ſerious, prudent, and affectionate, in the Education of their Children; becauſe ſuch a deportment is moſt likely to be owned by God with the deſired Succeſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And Oh that it might Convince us likewiſe of the</hi> Vanity of Youth, <hi>the ſhortneſs of our Lives, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of our Time, the nearneſs of our Change, the neceſſity, reaſonableneſs, and manifold advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of</hi> Remembring our Creator in our young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Years! <hi>And withal might haſten our Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſpirit our Deſires, to depart and be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, whenever God ſhall call us!</hi> That follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Example, who by Faith and Patience are gone to inherit the Promiſes, <hi>We may at length meet thoſe Precious Souls above, who are gone before us; that with them, and all the Children of the Kingdom, we may</hi> be for ever with the Lord, <hi>which is Beſt of all.</hi>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WHen after an unpleaſing ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Providence of God gave Opportunity of renewing our Converſe, in your Habitation; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd my ſelf an unmix'd ſatisfaction, during my ſtay with you: And as none is more oblig'd to rejoyce in all the Good, which you, or yours, are partakers of; ſo none could be more heartily diſpos'd to do it. Indeed the hopes of enjoying your Society ſweetned the fatigues of a Voyage, which (after many Years ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence) I lately made unto my own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: In which I was truly delighted to find, that not only your Perſon and Miniſtry were acceptable and uſeful, but
<pb facs="tcp:41795:104"/>that there was a proſpect that God would make your Houſe to grow. But when I was preparing to return, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that God had brought me to mourn with you, under a moſt afflictive Providence: In which though my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter had made me unfit to preſent Comfort to you; yet few of your Friends had more light to diſcern the deepneſs of your Wound, and greatneſs of your Loſs. For the intimate Friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, and our cohabitation in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> gave me opportunity of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the worth of <hi>Her,</hi> whom now you lament. Though this Conſideration, as it makes your Tryal greater, renders your Reſignation more acceptable to God, and uſeful to Men.</p>
                  <p>To part with an ordinary Poſſeſſion with willingneſs, is a kin to that <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> which is exercis'd under merited Puniſhment, which in the Apoſtles judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath no <hi>Glory</hi> or <hi>Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in it: <hi>(1 Pet. 1.20.)</hi> But 'tis an Heroick Spirit, a reſemblance of that Faith which dignifi'd the Father of all who believe, to give up a rare and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing
<pb facs="tcp:41795:104"/>Treaſure: And if any Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration hath ſtrength to work this Noble Diſpoſition in our Souls, that which is taken from the <hi>Glory</hi> of God, and the Redeemer, hath: 'Twas this which led my thoughts unto the Meditations in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe, which though much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the dignity of the Subject, am willing to make thus publick, that they may be a laſting Monument of the Gratitude and Reſpect I owe unto your Deceas'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, and with the Divine Bleſſing may be uſeful to thoſe who may be call'd unto like Tryals.</p>
                  <p>Many of your Brethren would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this Service with far more ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice unto both the Subjects of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, than one who is in a journeying State: But when your ſelf, and ſome near Relatives deſir'd this laſt Office, I was not unwilling to comply; eſpecially having the advantage of knowing by how ſingular a Providence your Marriage-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was brought about, and how happy it was to you both.</p>
                  <p>I need not tell you how this ſorrowful Event makes the thoughts of my intended
<pb facs="tcp:41795:105"/>Voyage much more uneaſie to me, who muſt leave ſo dear a Friend depriv'd of his delightful <hi>Half:</hi> But an <hi>Intereſt</hi> in the <hi>whole</hi> Deity, (who cannot dye) will abundantly compenſate this loſs, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with your long continuance in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Service, and the deſirable ſucceſs of your Labours, is with utmoſt earneſtneſs prayed for, by</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THE firſt hearing of theſe Words, which ſpeak of <hi>Sickneſs</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> may give ſome Indication of the ſorrowful Occaſion, that hath drawn more than uſual Numbers unto this <hi>Place:</hi> From which it hath pleas'd the All-wiſe God to remove <hi>One,</hi> who was a principal Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it; <hi>One</hi> whoſe conſtant Attendance, and Chriſtian Deportment in it, carried an exciting Influence unto all who were Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of 'em. And therefore it is no ſmall
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41795:106"/>loſs unto this whole Society, that they ſhall no longer enjoy the advantage of ſuch an Example; but even the privation of ſuch, whoſe Lives were exemplary, is capable of affording very conſiderable advantage: As we know that not only the Light of the <hi>Heavenly Bodies,</hi> is uſeful unto this lower World, their <hi>Eclipſe,</hi> have their advantages too, which are therefore thought worthy of peculiar Obſervation. It hath been a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Opinion, that the <hi>Eclipſes</hi> of the Sun and Moon have an Inſtructive ſignification, by which the Inhabitants of the Earth are warn'd and admoniſh'd. The Truth of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hath been queſtion'd, but 'tis certain that the Death of a Chriſtian, who did <hi>ſhine as a Light in the World,</hi> hath an Inſtructive Language, and is proper to teach very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Leſſons unto them who ſurvive. Such Providences do indeed call unto mourning and ſorrow, but this is not the principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of them: there is ſomething of far greater importance to employ our minds, on ſuch ſad occaſions, and that is, to receive the Spiritual Inſtruction that is then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us. It hath been counted an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the folly of ſome ſuperſtitious Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, that they would make a hideous noiſe whenever they ſaw the Sun, or Moon dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and variouſly expreſs'd their fears of loſing thoſe Luminaries, but made no uſeful enquiries into the Cauſes and Nature of thoſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41795:106"/>
                     <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> And 'tis very reproachful unto profeſſing Chriſtians, when they imagine that a paſſionate ſorrow is the only, or chief buſineſs that the Death of Chriſtian Friends calls 'em to: Our deportment on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſhould correſpond with our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Hope, which aſſures us, that they who <hi>are fallen aſleep in Chriſt</hi> are not loſt, (which in the Apoſtles Judgment is a ſelf-evident ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.18.) A deceaſed Chriſtian is not only more ſafe, but far more happy and honourable than <hi>he</hi> or <hi>ſhe</hi> was in this World: ſo that they need not our tears; which yet on other accounts are juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, but they muſt not hinder our ſerious enquiries into the Nature and Uſes of ſuch a Sorrowful object. When therefore we have loſt a living Example <hi>in the Deceaſed</hi> Mrs. <hi>Shower,</hi> we are oblig'd to make ſuch enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with relation unto her Death, that we may get ſome conſiderable and laſting advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from it; and in order unto this, I have thought theſe words of the Redeemer, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon a like occaſion, would afford ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Meditations, that may aſſiſt us to improve the late ſorrowful Providence. And when I have laid down the <hi>general</hi> Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons contain'd in 'em, I ſhall endeavour to apply 'em unto the <hi>particular</hi> ſubject of our Sorrow.</p>
                  <p>To underſtand the <hi>grounds</hi> and <hi>occaſion</hi> of the words read to you, we need only look
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41795:107"/>back to the few Verſes which precede the Text; and in the firſt verſe we find, that a Friend and Favourite of Chriſt, <hi>Lazarus</hi> the Brother of <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> is arreſted by a threatning Sickneſs. <hi>The favour and friendſhip of Chriſt do not exempt from Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Death.</hi> A <hi>Lazarus</hi> whom Jeſus lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is ſick and dieth. His Siſters ſeem to have concluded, that the affection which Chriſt had for their Brother, ſhould have ſecur'd him from theſe Calamities; and (tis probable) they thought, that nothing but the diſtance of place could hinder Chriſt from relieving their Brothers Caſe, which therefore they take care to acquaint him with, and ſend this ſorrowful Meſſage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Redeemer, <hi>Lord, behold he whom thou loveſt is ſick,</hi> ver. 3. They chooſe indeed the fitteſt Argument to plead on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion with Chriſt, when they repreſent to <hi>him</hi> the Intereſt that their Brother had in <hi>his</hi> peculiar Affection. They don't ſay, <q>He who is our Brother, and Beloved by us, or he who loveth thy Perſon, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is ſick:</q> They knew, that ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations (tho very forcible among men) could have but little weight upon <hi>him,</hi> who cannot be made a Debtor by all the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Service that any can expreſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him. No, they rightly conclude, that the Redeemers Love is free, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Obligation, and muſt be the only
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41795:107"/>Original of all that Relief, which he at any time beſtows. Thus far, I ſay, theſe Siſters were in the right; but the particle <hi>Behold!</hi> (which is a Note of Admiration) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates the Miſtake which they were guilty of, and that they were <hi>ſurpriz'd</hi> at the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and danger of their Brother, becauſe he was one whom Jeſus loved. Had this been the Caſe of a <hi>Scribe,</hi> or a <hi>Phariſee</hi> (two Orders which Chriſt had no kindneſs for) this would not have appeared ſtrange unto them, as it did, that one whom Chriſt loved, ſhould languiſh under a painful and threatning Diſeaſe. No queſtion they had often ſeen and heard the Redeemer expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a peculiar kindneſs unto their Brother, whoſe ſickneſs and danger made him now a Spectacle of Pity: And they knew not how to reconcile theſe two together, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were inclin'd to hope, that his love unto their Brother (as ſoon as he had an account of his danger) would induce him to make the greateſt haſte to viſit, and heal him, (both which he had done unto others who were ſtrangers.) But <hi>he</hi> intended to do neither, he determin'd to delay his viſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> until he had been four days dead: But tho he would not heal and recover ſick <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he ſends a moſt excellent Remedy unto his Siſters, to cure their miſtakes, to eaſe and heal their minds, which was the intention of this Reply unto their Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41795:108"/>Meſſage. <hi>This ſickneſs is not unto Death, but for the Glory of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In which we are called to conſider, 1. <hi>The Manner.</hi> 2. <hi>The Deſign.</hi> 3. <hi>The Import of this Anſwer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would make a few Reflections upon the two former, and then ſhall inſiſt upon the laſt, as moſt ſuitable to our preſent Affair.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. As to <hi>the Manner</hi> of this Anſwer: 'Tis eaſie to perceive the obſcurity and dubiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the former part; <hi>This Sickneſs is not unto Death:</hi> For the Event did (at leaſt) ſeem to contradict the literal meaning of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, which expreſly denies that the ſickneſs of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was unto Death, and yet <hi>Laxarus</hi> dyeth: This ſeeming contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muſt render this part of the Anſwer du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious and dark, unto thoſe to whom it was ſent. Indeed notwithſtanding this obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there was a moſt certain Truth in this part of the Anſwer, which ſpeaks of ſuch a <hi>Death,</hi> as truly anſwers that Character, <hi>viz.</hi> Such a Privation of Life, as puts a final Period unto it; on which account it can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaid of the Dead, <hi>That their places know 'em no more, and that they go the way whence they ſhall not return:</hi> Job 8.10. c. 16.22. As alſo, <hi>That they ſee corruption,</hi> Acts 13.36. The Body quite loſing that Organization, that makes it a fit Habitation for a humane Soul: This is the primary and proper notion of Death, and under which the Spirit of God
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41795:108"/>ſpeaks of it: (See <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21, 26, 54, 56. Not to mention ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places.) Unto <hi>ſuch a Death</hi> the ſickneſs of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was not; his Death was not a final Period, but only a ſhort interruption or ceſſation of Life, which (like ſome Rivers which run under ground for a ſpace) only for a while diſappear'd, and then was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain brought to light. This being granted, we cannot deny, that there is ſome dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the manner of expreſſion. Had it ſo pleaſed the Redeemer, he could have ſpoken in a much plainer Language, he could have ſaid, <q>Tho this ſickneſs ſhall deprive <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> of his Life, yet it ſhall ſoon be reſtored to him again; tho' he ſhall truly die, yet he ſhall not long remain under the power of Death; for I deſign to work a Miracle to raiſe him from the dead:</q> Thus could the Redeemer have expreſſed himſelf, had it ſo pleaſed him, but he chooſeth to ſpeak obſcurely not only to theſe Siſters, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to his Apoſtles, when he ſaid, <hi>Our friend Lazarus ſleepeth,</hi> v. 11. Which Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical and dark way of ſpeaking led them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a miſtake, as we read <hi>v.</hi> 13. Many other inſtances of this kind might be produc'd, as that which this Evangeliſt relateth <hi>Ch.</hi> 16.16, 17, 18. And as the Language, ſo the Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Chriſt hath obſcurity in it; his <hi>ways are unſearchable, and his footſteps are not known,</hi> both with reſpect unto viſible Providences, and inviſible dealings with the Soul.</p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:41795:109"/>
                  <p>Many there are whom Chriſt really loveth, who walk in darkneſs, are brought into a kind of a Labyrinth, where they are ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perplext, and are tempted to conclude, that their Lord hath quite forſaken, and caſt 'em off, when he retains the kindeſt and moſt gracious purpoſes toward 'em. As God did toward <hi>Abraham</hi> when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to go out of his Countrey, and yet did not acquaint him with the Place which was deſign'd to be his Inheritance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8. Thus was <hi>Abraham</hi> try'd, and ſo are the Children of <hi>Abraham;</hi> as indeed this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of God is admirably ſuited unto the ſtate of Probation in which we now are. All that darkneſs and perplexity which at any time we are brought into, are deſign'd by God, to try and diſcover the ſincerity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of our obedience. And 'tis our grand concern to ſtand out this Tryal, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go this Probation aright; and then whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver darkneſs there is now in the dealings of Chriſt, he will after a while ſcatter every Cloud, and will be an everlaſting Light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. 'Twere eaſie to make large Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon this Subject, but your own Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation can ſupply this defect; Nor may I dwell long upon the</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Obſervable in the Text: The <hi>Deſign</hi> of this Anſwer made by Chriſt, which was to afford preſent Support unto the dejected Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Lazarus.</hi> He whoſe Eye diſcerns the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41795:109"/>moſt hidden and diſtant Objects, knows how their tender Hearts were diſquieted; and that ſuch a Spectacle as a deceaſed dying Brother muſt wound and afflict their Souls; and the more, when their Expectations were diſappointed, as to the ſpeedy viſit of Chriſt. <q>What! (might they be apt to argue) not make ſo <hi>charitable,</hi> ſo <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> a Viſit, to one whom he loveth, to one who needs his help, and muſt periſh without it? Is this Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to neglect a diſtreſſed Friend, till Life and all be gone?</q> Such diſquieting Thoughts would begin to ruſh into, and diſorder their Minds: Now 'twas to ſtill this Tempeſt, that the Redeemer ſends this Reply to 'em. <hi>This Sickneſs is not unto Death, but for the Glory of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> 
                     <q>Though the Danger and Progreſs of this Sickneſs, joyn'd with my ſeeming Neglect of their Brother, will be an Occaſion of Trouble unto them; Sorrow and Fear will take hold of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, yet let not their Hearts be troubled, there is no juſt ground of diſquieting Fear; notwithſtanding the diſmal Appearances, this Matter will have a happy and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Iſſue.</q> 
                     <hi>When our Lord Jeſus doth not grant the expected Relief, yet he always provides Support and Conſolation for his faithful Followers.</hi> When <hi>He</hi> determin'd to ſend away the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes who had followed him into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, he reſolves that he will not ſend 'em away faſting, leſt they ſhould <hi>faint by the way,</hi>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:41795:110"/>Mat. 16.32. Though they muſt for a time be deprived of his Preſence, yet he takes care, that they might not <hi>faint</hi> and periſh. This was his Carriage toward his Apoſtles in general, and more particularly toward the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who when he <hi>beſought the Lord thrice that the Meſſenger of Satan might depart from him;</hi> tho' this Requeſt was not granted, tho' the <hi>Thorn</hi> in the <hi>Fleſh</hi> was not removed, yet this moſt ſupporting Anſwer was given to him, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. Sometimes the Carriage of Chriſt bears an Aſpect of Unkindneſs and Neglect; but even at ſuch a time, his Heart is fill'd with Love, and his Hand is employ'd to Support. 'Tis worthy our notice, what care the Spirit of God hath taken to remove the Suſpition of Unkindneſs in the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, toward his Friend <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whom he refus'd to Viſit and Recover, as his Siſters requeſted and expected; for in the Verſe which immediately follows this Anſwer of Chriſt, the Evangeliſt adds this cautioning Remark, <hi>Now Jeſus loved Martha, and her Siſter, and Lazarus.</hi> His not complying with their intimated Deſire (of having their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeedily Recover'd) did not proceed from Unkindneſs, or want of Affection (tho' there was appearance of them.) No, he bore the ſame Love unto a ſick and dying <hi>Lazarus,</hi> as if he had wrought a Miracle to prevent his Sickneſs and Death. 'Twere
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41795:110"/>eaſie to enlarge upon this Head, but I muſt proceed unto the</p>
                  <p n="3">III. And Principal Obſervable in the Text, The <hi>Import</hi> and <hi>Sence</hi> of this <hi>Anſwer:</hi> And if it be remembred that the Sickneſs of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was Mortal, there will be found theſe two General <hi>Propoſitions</hi> contain'd in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>The Sickneſs and Death of thoſe who are the Friends of Chriſt do bring a peculiar Glory unto God, and the Redeemer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>This one Conſideration is ſufficient to quiet and ſupport the Followers of Chriſt under thoſe ſorrowful Providences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I need not ſpend time to prove how evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently theſe Truths are contain'd in this Anſwer of Chriſt: which though given in a particular Caſe, yet carrieth ſuch a general Inſtruction, as reacheth unto Chriſtians in all Ages of the World. 'Tis granted, that there were ſingular Circumſtances that attended the Sickneſs and Death of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and a moſt glorious Miracle was wrought in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him from the Dead: But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there are other grounds which juſtifie the general Concluſions which are drawn from the words. In which 'tis manifeſt (as has been obſerv'd) our Lord deſign'd to quiet and eaſe the troubled Minds of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Siſters, who had now a ſorrowful Proſpect of loſing a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Brother. And in order to this, he thought it enough (without mentioning his miraculous Raiſing from the Dead) only to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41795:111"/>inform them, That the threatning Sickneſs of their Brother was <hi>for the glory of God, and that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.</hi> This one Conſideration, when it ſinds due Entertainment in, and hath a right Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon a believing Soul, is able to ſtill all the diſquieting Motions that Sorrow and Fear have raiſed there.</p>
                  <p>I have not deſign'd a diſtinct handling of theſe Two Propoſitions; 'twill be as uſeful to joyn both together in a plain and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Method: And therefore ſhall,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Give a ſhort Account of the <hi>Glory</hi> of God and Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Shew how the <hi>Sickneſs</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of thoſe who are the Friends of Chriſt does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute unto it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. On what Accounts the Conſideration of this hath ſuch a <hi>quieting</hi> and <hi>ſupporting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſluence</hi> upon a Chriſtian; and after ward draw ſome inſtructive <hi>Inferences</hi> from theſe memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable words. As to the</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Nature of that Glory which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto God and Chriſt: On which I ſhall only make a very few Remarks, becauſe it may be hoped that few Chriſtians are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with this common Subject.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Glory,</hi> in its general Idea, or Notion, is nothing but ſome great Excellence mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſted and acknowledged; whence 'tis that <hi>it</hi> makes ſo very ſtrong an Impreſſion upon Intelligent Creatures, and the deſire of <hi>it,</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:41795:111"/>hath ſo univerſal an Influence. More par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Glory of God is the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great and adorable <hi>Excellencies</hi> which are in the <hi>Deity,</hi> both abſolutely and relatively conſidered. When the <hi>Virtues</hi> (as the <hi>Greek</hi> Expreſſion is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10.) <hi>of God are ſhown forth,</hi> ſo as to be acknowledg'd and eſteemed by his Creatures: When his inflexible Juſtice, and ſpotleſs Purity, his unſearchable Wiſdom, and infallible Truth, his Almighty Power, and inexhauſtible Goodneſs do ſhine forth, and are ſet in a juſt Light, then the Glory of God appears in open view, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.21. God ſweareth that <hi>all the Earth ſhould be filled with the Glory of the Lord;</hi> becauſe he intended to diſplay his Juſtice and Holineſs, in puniſhing and conſuming the murmuring <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> Thus 'tis ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.16. <hi>When the Lord buildeth up Zion, he ſhall appear in his Glory,</hi> becauſe that Work would manifeſt the Power and Veracity of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Glory of Chriſt, is, the ſhewing forth that <hi>Excellence</hi> which belongs unto his <hi>Mediatory Office;</hi> accordingly, when he wrought his firſt Miracle at <hi>Cana,</hi> he is ſaid to have <hi>manifeſted forth his Glory,</hi> Joh. 2.11. All the Evidences which bear Witneſs unto his Prieſtly, or Regal, or Teaching Offices, do gloriſie the Redeemer, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17.</p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:41795:112"/>
                  <p n="3">3. It muſt be remembred, that the Glory of the <hi>Deity,</hi> is diſtinct from that of the <hi>Redeemer;</hi> yet they are never ſeparated from, much leſs oppoſed unto each other. 'Tis otherwiſe, as to the Glory of God, and of a Creature; theſe do often diſagree and claſh againſt each other. When <hi>Herod</hi> accepted an undue Honour from a flattering Crowd; this took away the Honour that was <hi>due unto God,</hi> Acts 12.23. but the <hi>Honour</hi> that is <hi>given unto Chriſt,</hi> doth bring <hi>Glory unto God,</hi> Joh. 17.1. Theſe two are ſo inſeparably joyn'd together, that they can never be put aſunder. Let us now enquire,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How the <hi>Sickneſs</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of thoſe who are the Friends of Chriſt, do bring <hi>Glory</hi> unto God and the Redeemer: While our Eye is ſixt only upon the dark ſide (or Superſicies) of this Object, we ſhall be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put ſuch a Queſtion as once <hi>Nathanael</hi> did concerning <hi>Nazareth,</hi> Joh 1.46. <hi>Can any good thing</hi> come from ſuch Evil? Can ſo barren a Soil produce ſuch precious Fruit as the Glory of God? Can this dark and diſmal Cloud ſend forth ſuch a refreſhing Light? At the firſt view it ſeems diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable unto God, when theſe Bodies, which are his Temples, are demoliſh'd and laid in the Duſt: This, I ſay, ſeems a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto him who rais'd and dwelt in 'em. When theſe pleaſant Plants which ſtood in the Courts of God are overturn'd, this ſeems
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41795:112"/>a damage unto the Heavenly Husbandman: But notwithſtanding theſe Objections of Senſe, 'tis undeniably true, that the Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Diſſolution of Chriſtians, do really contribute unto the Glory of God and Chriſt: The Evidences which confirm this, do relate both unto thoſe Chriſtians who are remov'd by Death, and unto thoſe who ſurvive.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. With reſpect unto the Dying Friends of Chriſt themſelves: Their <hi>Sickneſs</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> do many ways bring Glory unto God and the Redeemer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Divine <hi>Veracity</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi> is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by executing the Primitive Sentence, which hath been given againſt all the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of fallen <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Duſt thou art, and unto Duſt thou ſhalt return.</hi> A peculiar Glory redounds unto God, when theſe Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations which ſignifie his Councel and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are punctually accompliſht. (As on the contrary, nothing is more diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in its own Nature than <hi>Falſhood,</hi> which is counted, even by Lyars themſelves, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Reproach.) Compare <hi>Num.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. with <hi>ver.</hi> 35. The Death of every Chriſtian doth ſeal unto the Truth of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Divine <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and hatred of Sin, are honour'd by the <hi>Sickneſs</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of thoſe Chriſtians who have provok'd the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, though they die in Peace. We have memorable Inſtances in <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> and the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Chriſtians; ſome of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41795:113"/>whom were cut off by Death, though not Condemned with the World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30, 32. Concerning <hi>Moſes,</hi> we read, that by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed Language he offended God: At one time he complain'd of his Service and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and deſired rather to <hi>die,</hi> than <hi>bear it any longer,</hi> Num. 11.14, 15. At another time he ſpoke with indecent Paſſion unto the <hi>Iſraeltes;</hi> and then God pronounc'd the <hi>Arreſt</hi> which you read, <hi>Num.</hi> 20.12. That he ſhould not bring the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into the <hi>Promiſed Land.</hi> Now the executing of that Sentence did glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, becauſe it manifeſted his Holineſs, which could not behold the deſiling Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes that were in <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was one of the moſt eminent Favourites of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Divine <hi>Sovereignty</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> are honour'd by the Obedience and Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Sick and Dying Believers; When a Chriſtian exerciſes that Submiſſion unto the Orders of God, that he willingly drinks the bittereſt Cup which his Father gives him; how Honourable muſt this be unto God I This laſt act of Obedience Crowns the whole Chriſtian courſe: certainly there is no Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle more grateful unto God, than a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian chearfully yielding back his Soul unto him who gave it: 'Twas a reſigning Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that rendred the Death of Chriſt <hi>a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour</hi> unto God, who was in a moſt eminent manner glorified by it: Though a Dying Chriſtian cannot
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41795:113"/>offer an Attoning Sacrifice, yet he is a kind of <hi>Holocauſt,</hi> when his Death is perfum'd with a choſen Submiſſion unto the diſpoſing Will of God. On this Account <hi>the Death of the Saints,</hi> (or as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word imports) the Favourites, <hi>is precious in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 116.15.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Powerful Grace of Chriſt</hi> is honour'd by the inward ſupport and refreſhment which ſick and dying Chriſtians receive from him; at a time when the <hi>Daughters of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick are brought low,</hi> and all the Pleaſures of Life are without reliſh; then to feel an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorating ſtrength which renews the inner Man, when the outer decays, and is ſalling down; this magnifieth the powerful Grace of God, <hi>who giveth power to the Faint; and to them that have no Might, encreaſeth Strength,</hi> Iſa. 40.29. A Principle of Natural Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage will afford ſome Support; but 'tis Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace alone which can enable a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to triumph over the Pain and Danger of a Mortal Sickneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Eſpecially God and Chriſt are glorified in the <hi>Victory</hi> which a Chriſtian gains over Death: This laſt Enemy is a very Formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one. An <hi>Alexander,</hi> who could Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the vaſt Armies of <hi>Aſian</hi> Monarchs, who had deſpiſed the Terrour of Battels, in his laſt Sickneſs was ſo afraid of Death, that his Court was ſill'd with Diviners and Victims, and all imaginable Methods were try'd to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41795:114"/>preſerve his Life. When therefore a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, though of the tender, fearful Sex, is raiſed above the Fear of Death, is <hi>confident, and willing rather to be abſent from the Body, and preſent with the Lord,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.5. This doth highly Honour the Grace and Power of the Redeemer, through whom alone it is that <hi>a Chriſtian is more than a Conqueror,</hi> Rom. 8.36, 37.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Redeemer is glorified in that <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs</hi> which he immediately confers upon the Souls of his deceaſed Friends. No ſooner had the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> paſs'd the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and got upon free Land, but they ſend up their joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Praiſes, and mention how gloriouſly God had Triumphed over their Enemies: What Heart can conceive the Songs of Praiſe which Celebrate the Lamb, and him who ſits upon the Throne, when one believing Soul is ſet free from the Houſe of Bondage, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into the Heavenly Countrey? when a Soul that is Impriſon'd and Fetter'd in a Houſe of Clay, is received into the heavenly Habitations which the Redeemer hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared? Surely, if thoſe who heard of the Converſion of <hi>Paul,</hi> glorified God in him, or on his account; thoſe who were Witneſſes and Spectators of a far more ſurprizing Change, could not be wanting in their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and Praiſes of that God who Crowns with unfading Glory.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Death of a Chriſtian brings glory
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41795:114"/>unto the Redeemer, as it is the Occaſion of that aſtoniſhing Operation, which will <hi>raiſe the diſſolved Body,</hi> and transform it into the likeneſs of his own moſt glorious Body. The ſinal Conquering of the laſt Enemy, muſt be exceeding glorious unto that Power which effects it. The Raiſing of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtating his Body in a periſhing Life, did glorifie the Redeemer; and this he had his Eye upon in making this Anſwer: What then muſt be the Raiſing of a Corrupted Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy unto a bleſſed Immortality? By which the Children of the Reſurrection are made like the Angels of God: Read and conſider that memorable paſſage, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. Let us now brieſly reflect upon the</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Evidence which I propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> How the <hi>Sickneſs</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of Chriſtians glorifie God, with reſpect unto them who ſurvive, whether they be more nearly or diſtantly related. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God is thus glorified on ſuch Occaſions, becauſe he manifeſts his Divine Power in compenſating and ſupplying that Loſs. When uſeful and ſerviceable Chriſtians are removed by Death, nothing but Almighty Power can fill up ſuch a void empty ſpace, and raiſe up others to carry on his Work; ſo that the Church reſembles that Poetical Tree, in which as faſt as one Branch was broken off, another did ſpring in the ſame place: Thus when <hi>Moſes</hi> dies, God finds
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41795:115"/>a <hi>Joſhua</hi> who was qualified to ſucceed him: When a <hi>David</hi> is laid unto his Father's, and ſees Corruption, God ſills his Throne with a <hi>Solomon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Exerciſes of Graces in ſurviving Relatives or Acquaintance, doth glorifie God on ſuch Occaſions. When holy <hi>Job,</hi> upon the ſurprizing Death of all his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (at the ſame time) doth Adore the Sovereignty of God, and bleſſeth his Name, when he took his deareſt Comforts away; this did effectually refute the reproaching Accuſation of Satan, and brought a ſingular Honour to God; who is alſo</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Glorified</hi> in the Comforting of thoſe who are troubled and caſt down by ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences: This is one glorious Character of the bleſſed God, <hi>That he comforteth thoſe who are caſt down,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.6. Did not his Hand bind up the Wound, no other could do it; all the Conſolations which a Creature can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, are weak and ineffectual things; but the ſupports of the heavenly Comforter are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more ſenſible than under the ſenſe of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive Providences, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3, 4. In the</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And Laſt place, The <hi>Sickneſs</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of Chriſtians bring Glory unto God, as they are ſerviceable unto the Souls of them who ſurvive: As thoſe Fruits that fall from the Tree, and lye about it, make the Soyl more fruitful; ſuch ſorrowful Providences being excellent Inſtructions about our Duty, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41795:115"/>powerful Arguments to excite us unto our great Work: What the Apoſtle ſaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his <hi>Bonds,</hi> was equally true concerning his <hi>Death:</hi> They were <hi>for the furtherance of the Goſpel,</hi> Phil. 1. How many have owed their Converſion and Eſtabliſhment unto the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels</hi> and <hi>Examples</hi> of dying Chriſtians? The Hiſtories of every Church abound with ſuch Inſtances. I ſhould now have ſhewed,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. On what accounts this Conſideration is ſufficient to <hi>Quiet</hi> and <hi>Support</hi> a Chriſtian under ſuch ſorrowſul Providences: Of this I ſhall give this Threefold Account.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>Love</hi> which a Chriſtian bears un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God and Chriſt, makes their Honour dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto him than any Intereſt of his own; and conſequently, the advancing of that will ſweeten all the Croſſes that can oppreſs him. When <hi>Jeptha</hi>'s Victory over the <hi>Amonites</hi> had got him more than ordinary Honour; this was ſo pleaſing to his Daughter, that ſhe was willing to endure the harſh Effects of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Vow, <hi>Judg.</hi> 10.36. Such a temper there was in the Apoſtle, when he could declare that his chief Expectation and Deſign was, that Chriſt might be magniſied in his Body, whether by Life or Death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Chriſtian knows that when God and Chriſt are glorified, then the grand <hi>Purpoſe</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of God are attained: We are ſure that the bleſſed God cannot deſign any Gain or Proſit to himſelf in his Actings, but his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41795:116"/>deſign is to get himſelf Glory; and it muſt be very delightful unto God, when this Councel of God is accompliſh'd.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Chriſtian obtains his own chief <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt</hi> when God is glorified; all his other Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions are ſubordinate unto this: He remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that the Hallowing or Glorifying of God's Name ſtands in the very firſt place in that Exemplar Prayer which Chriſt hath left unto the Church; and therefore when God doth glorifie himſelf, though in a way that is grievous unto the Humane Nature, yet a Chriſtian Rejoyceth. And now it were eaſie to draw many inſtructive Inferences from this Anſwer made by Chriſt: As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It will follow from hence, that the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Death of the moſt holy and uſeful Perſons,
<note place="margin">Applicat.</note> is no Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Providence and Government of God. 'Twas uſual among the Heathens to Accuſe their Gods; yea, ſome of 'em proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deny the Exiſtence and Providence of a <hi>Deity,</hi> becauſe ſome <hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>vertuous</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were taken away by a ſurprizing Death. The <hi>Epicurean,</hi> who diſputes againſt <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> thought his Queries unanſwerable, when he ask'd, Why (if there was a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) the two brave <hi>Scipio</hi>'s were Routed and Slain by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cicer.</hi> de N. D. l. 3.</note> with ſeveral ſuch like Queſtions, which were more tolerable in the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles who knew not God; but it is inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41795:116"/>in thoſe who have the Oracles of God committed unto them, to think or ſpeak at ſuch a rate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What adorable Wiſdom belongs unto the bleſſed God, who can glorifie himſelf by thoſe very events that ſeem moſt diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable unto him: 'Tis obſerved by the Apoſtle, that <hi>the fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer than men,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.25. <hi>i. e.</hi> In thoſe very events which ſeem inconſiſtent with Wiſdom, wherein God ſeems to act fooliſhly, yet in them he (infinitely) ſurpaſſes all the skill and Wiſdom that are in men. The Divine Wiſdom can build Trophies upon thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry places which ſeem to ſwallow it up: The cutting off the natural Branches, the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the Body of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, at the firſt view appear'd diſhonourable unto the Truth and Fidelity of God; but the conſideration of this event draws from the Apoſtle that admiring Exclamation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. v. 33. <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge of God!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. How vaſt is the diſtance between the Thoughts of God, and thoſe of Men! <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.8. The ſubject of the Text gives a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable inſtance: The Siſters of <hi>Lazarus</hi> might be apt to conclude that their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Sickneſs and Death would be on va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious accounts diſhonourable unto Chriſt: 1. As they ſeemed to import Unkindneſs, or Impotence in Chriſt, who on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41795:117"/>carry'd it, as if he either neglected his Friend, or was unable to help him: And 2. As they ſeem'd to argue the unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Chriſts Service. When <hi>Lazarus</hi> was Dead and laid in his Grave, thoſe who knew the Friendſhip of the Redeemer unto him, would be tempted to ſpeak on this manner: <q>How little advantage hath poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> got by his Acquaintance with, and ſervice unto Chriſt, who if he had Power to Recover and prevent the Death of his Sick Friend, has been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſtrange unkindneſs.</q> But in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, the Sickneſs and Death of <hi>Lazarus</hi> did bring a far greater Honour unto Chriſt, than his recovering would have done: That Miracle which was wrought in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him from the Dead, did exalt the Name of Chriſt, and encreaſed the number of his Followers; take heed therefore of leaning unto your own underſtanding, but whenever the ways of God have a perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſcurity in them, imitate the Practice of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.17. Go into the Sanctuary, and view them in Scripture light; this will diſcover a refreſhing brightneſs in thoſe Events which have the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. How real and great a difference doth Converting Grace make between a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and the unbelieving World! The latter are wholly inſenſible unto the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41795:117"/>us'd in the Text; the glory of God and Chriſt have no efficacy to quiet and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their minds; Arguments taken from their own Reputation or Intereſt, have ſome force to moderate Sorrow and keep it from exceſs; but the glorifying of God by their Croſſes, is an Argument which hath no ſtrength with them; whereas it hath the greateſt with a Chriſtian, to whom nothing elſe need be repreſented: Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour well underſtood to whom he made the Anſwer in the Text; they were his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Diſciples, who were capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the force of this Conſideration; which afterward our Saviour repeats unto <hi>Martha,</hi> v. 40. <hi>Thou ſhouldeſt ſee the glory of God:</hi> Unto a <hi>Martha</hi> this would be a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and tranſporting ſpectacle, when a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> had far rather ſee thirty pieces of Silver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (than this glory of God.) Let us try our ſelves by this Rule; this will diſcover our State and our Character, and whether our Patience under Tryals be a Chriſtian Grace, or but a Philoſophick Virtue; this latter groweth from other Principles; when therefore our Minds are quieted under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting Providences, without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto the ſupport of the Text, 'tis a ſad evidence that we are alienated from the Life of God: If the conſideration of his <hi>Glory</hi> cannot over-ballance the Pain and Loſs that we are expos'd to, we are very
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41795:118"/>unlike to our Redeemer, whoſe troubled Soul was compoſed with this Thought, that his Fathers Name would be glorified by his accurs'd Death, <hi>John</hi> 12.27, 28.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let us whom this ſorrowful occaſion hath drawn together (and all who but hear of it) give diligence to correſpond with the deſign that God hath in this ſevere Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: Surely he hath not made this breach, only to open a paſſage unto Sorrow and Compaſſion, much leſs to furniſh us with new matter of diſcourſe: No, he deſigns that we ſhould glorifie him in our Hearts and Lives, more than we have formerly done: And this leads me unto that <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Application</hi> which I propounded to ſpend ſome time in, and which will aſſiſt us in making that Improvement of this Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as will bring glory unto God. All that I ſhall add will fall under theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Directions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us juſtifie this ſevere Providence of God: 'Tis highly diſhonourable unto him when we blame and accuſe his ways, as if they were not equal; as on the other hand 'tis Honourable to God, when we ſubſcribe every <hi>Arreſt</hi> that our Heavenly Judge hath pronounc't. 'Tis related concerning <hi>Aaron,</hi> that when his two Sons were cut off, he held his peace, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.2, 3. He made no Objections againſt that tremendous ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, when he underſtood that He
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41795:118"/>had glorified himſelf by that Act. Bleſſed be God who enableth the <hi>Relict</hi> of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd thus to glorifie God: May this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Reſignation very much exalt the Name of God, and bring Reputation unto ſtrict and ſerious Religion. Let this concluſion be deeply fix'd in all our Souls, that however ſevere the dealings of God are, they are always Righteous and Equal.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us Honour and Imitate the Holy Example of the Deceas'd Friend of Chriſt, the worthy Mrs. <hi>Shower.</hi> None I hope will expect a large Hiſtorical account of her Life, or a Funeral Encomiaſtick; this latter ſhe needs not, for her own Works praiſe her in the gate, and are a more valuable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, than any made by Art.</p>
                  <p>Her <hi>Parentage</hi> and <hi>Beauty,</hi> her <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Charms</hi> of Converſation (tho' even thoſe were Gifts from above) muſt now be paſs'd over in ſilence; for all theſe are <hi>Praeda Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> a Prey unto Death and the Grave; which conſideration ought to cure the undue Eſteem of them, that many profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians diſcover; and perhaps, few places are more guilty of this <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian Error,</hi> than this City, where it ſeems to be the chief Ambition of many, to out-vye others in every thing, rather than in real Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is the only Ornament that Death cannot ſpoil us of; accordingly I ſhall only take notice of thoſe Excellencies
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41795:119"/>which do fit the dignifying Character of <hi>Lazarus</hi> unto her, <hi>One whom Jeſus loved:</hi> (And however uſeful and honourable the Love of our Acquaintance and Fellow-creatures may be unto us, yet at laſt this Character of Sick and Dying <hi>Lazarus</hi> will be more valued, than any the moſt admir'd Titles of Honour.) To make good this Character, it will not be neceſſary to Deſcribe her in her Perſonal and Relative Capacities; in both which, thoſe who knew Her will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that ſhe had not many Equals, 'Twill be enough to draw the few following Lineaments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Holy Wiſdom which did ſhine in her Conduct, and which ſhe diſcover'd, both in leaving her Native Land, to enjoy the advantages of Living in a Religious Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (to which ſhe was related,) and in the Choice that ſhe made when ſhe changed her Condition: Neither the prejudices of the Age, or the Advantage of other offers, could hinder from accepting <hi>One,</hi> as the Partner of her Life, from whom ſhe could expect the beſt aſſiſtance in the Service of God, and the concerns of her Soul; and this ſhe did at a time when there was no proſpect of that Tranquility, which now encourageth Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his Character and Profeſſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Her Conſcientious Attendance upon the Publick Worſhip: Of this I am capable to give Witneſs, having had the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41795:119"/>of Living a conſiderable time under the ſame Roof; and have obſerv'd how Her Love unto the Solomn Aſſemblies, made Her overcome many difficulties, which are pleaded by others in excuſe of their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; neither the Heat or Cold of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor the hazard to her Health, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when great with Child) could induce her to loſe any Opportunity of waiting at the Gates of Wiſdom; ſuch Advantages were pleaſant, and ſuch Seaſons were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing unto her Soul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Acquaintance ſhe had with Secret Religion: She was not one of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors who ſhut up their Religion within the Temple Walls, where they take it up, and leave it at their departure: No, ſhe made many ſecret Viſits unto her Heavenly Bridegroom, and from him obtain'd that Wiſdom and Modeſty, and other Virtues which adorn'd her Converſation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Her ſubmiſſion unto the diſpoſing Will of God, and the comforting hopes ſhe had, do compleat the Character <hi>of one whom Jeſus Loved</hi> in this World, and hath now receiv'd in the other, where ſhe is plac'd out of the reach of Sin and Sorrow, of Child-bearing Pains, and Child-bed Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and where no Clouds ſhall ever inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Light of God, and of the Lamb: But if we deſire to meet her there, we muſt imitate her Faith and Holineſs: And</p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:41795:120"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, Let us glorifie God by receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inſtruction which this ſorrowful Providence preſents to us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Concerning the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty of Life:</hi> when ſo bright and Vigorous a Flame is ſuddenly Extinguiſht, who can entertain a juſt expectation of a long Life? What folly muſt it be to reckon upon many years, when our Lives are in ſo perpetual hazard? Let us <hi>number our days aright,</hi> and fix upon our Hearts that Concluſion which <hi>David</hi> made, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.18. <hi>Our days on the Earth are as a ſhadow, and there is no abiding;</hi> which conſideration had no queſtion a ſtrong influence upon that famous Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity toward the Service of God, which is related in that Chapter; and it would make <hi>us</hi> more active in his Service.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Learn the <hi>Vanity of Creature-aſſiſtances;</hi> could the Love of a Husband, or the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Phyſitians, or the Service of Friends have been Effectual, there had not been an occaſion for this ſorrowful Solemnity. 'Tis become Natural to us, to place an undue confidence in Created helps; exceeding apt we are to truſt in Riches or Wiſdom, and in the means of Health, when in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they are empty and broken Ciſterns, which will ſend us away diſappointed and aſham'd.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The neceſſity of ſpeedy <hi>Preparation</hi> for <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Judgment;</hi> every Funeral preſſeth
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41795:120"/>this upon thoſe who are witneſſes of it. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you have lately heard

                     </note> the Nature and Importance of this great work, and ſo many have diſcourſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, that I need not enlarge: It hath not been without a deſign worthy of the Wiſdom of God, that our Deceas'd Friend ſhould not be called out of the World by Death, until ſhe was known unto two Societies in this City, whereby her Death is rendred more Inſtructive. And now that a Funeral Sermon hath drawn Multitudes to attend here, you will receive no advantage from it, yea 'twill prove very hurtful to you, if you do not ſeriouſly engage, that you will give all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to prepare for Death and Eternity. This work is never unſeaſonable, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be pleaded to excuſe the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of it.</p>
                  <p>You who are <hi>Young,</hi> and in the Flower of your days, do not put off this Affair; ſay not as the negligent <hi>Jews</hi> once did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Rebuilding of their Temple, <hi>The time is not come,</hi> Hag. 1.2.

What meaneſt thou then, <hi>O Sleeper!</hi> ariſe and call upon God, and ſtir up thy ſelf that thou periſh not; look of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten down into the Chambers of the Grave; dwell (by ſolemn Thoughts) in the Valley of the Shadow of Death: Be not afraid leſt this ſhould make thee Melancholly or Diſtracted, for this path leads unto the moſt deſireable Joy.
